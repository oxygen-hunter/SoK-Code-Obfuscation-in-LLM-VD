   Vulnerable Line: 97
   Reason: The function `safeputs` is used to print the value of certain objects without checking the length of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the object exceeds the buffer size.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure

4. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption

   Reason: The code does not check if the `GetEmptyReq` function returns a valid request pointer before using it, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the function fails to allocate memory for the request.

   Reason: The code does not check if the `_XReply` function successfully receives a reply from the server before accessing the `rep` structure, which can lead to undefined behavior if the reply is not received.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure pointer conversion: The function `ptr_converter` performs a pointer conversion based on the task type without proper validation. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as type confusion or memory corruption.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure use of strcpy function in socket_create_unix function at line 34. 
     Reason: The strcpy function does not check the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
   - Insecure use of strcpy function in socket_connect_unix function at line 58.
     Reason: The strcpy function does not check the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
   - Lack of input validation in socket_connect function at line 123.
     Reason: The function does not validate the input address parameter, which can lead to potential security issues like buffer overflow or format string vulnerabilities.

   - Use safer string functions like strncpy with proper buffer size checks to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
   - Implement input validation for user-controlled input to prevent security issues like buffer overflow or format string vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerability type: Command Injection
3. Vulnerable lines: 97, 99, 101
4. Reason: The `server_process_entry_meta` function processes input strings without proper validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is controlled by an attacker. Specifically, the function uses the `startswith` function to check the beginning of the input string, but it does not validate the content of the input string beyond that point. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the input strings in a way that bypasses the current checks.

   Vulnerable Lines: Line 93
   Reason: The function `tacacs_get_password` allocates memory for the `pass` variable using `strdup`, but it does not free this memory if an error occurs or when the function finishes. This can lead to memory leaks in the application.
