   Vulnerable Lines: 78, 86, 94
   Reason: The code lacks proper synchronization mechanisms when accessing shared resources such as the connection mutex. This can lead to race conditions and potential security vulnerabilities like data corruption or deadlock.",1303,196,2.60152554512024
21_caption.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: 63, 67
   Reason: The code uses the `InterpretImageProperties` function to interpret the `filename` and `caption` properties without proper validation. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is provided.

3. Vulnerability Type: Memory Leak
   Vulnerable Line: 77, 109, 131, 153, 175
   Reason: The code allocates memory for strings but does not free them before returning, leading to memory leaks.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 77, 109, 131, 153, 175
   Reason: The code does not validate the input strings before using them, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the input is malicious or malformed.",3118,181,2.4159815311431885

       - Line 68: `generate_hash` function uses MD4 hash.
       - Line 96: `generate_hash` function is called with the password and challenge strings.
   - Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform input validation on user inputs, such as usernames and passwords obtained from the client. This can lead to buffer overflow or injection attacks.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 126: User input from the client is directly used without proper validation.
       - Line 144: User input from the client is directly used without proper validation.
   - Use of Deprecated Functions: The code uses `getpass` function, which is deprecated and not recommended for secure password handling.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 228: Usage of `getpass` function for password input.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure cryptographic hash function, lack of input validation, and use of deprecated functions.

45_trace_event_perf.c,"1. Vulnerable: YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in perf_trace_event_reg function at line 41. The function allocates memory for the list variable using alloc_percpu, but it does not properly handle the allocation failure. If the allocation fails, it directly jumps to the fail label without freeing the previously allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_reg function at line 63. If the allocation of perf_trace_buf fails, the function jumps to the fail label without freeing the previously allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_reg function at line 77. If the registration of tp_event fails, the function jumps to the fail label without freeing the previously allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_reg function at line 85. If the registration of tp_event fails, the function jumps to the fail label without freeing the previously allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_unreg function at line 102. If the perf_refcount is greater than 0, the function does not free the perf_events memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_unreg function at line 113. If the total_ref_count is 0, the function does not free the perf_trace_buf memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_unreg function at line 118. If the total_ref_count is 0, the function does not free the perf_trace_buf memory, leading to a memory leak.
   - Memory leak vulnerability in perf_trace_event_unreg function at line 121. If the total_ref_count is 0, the function does not free the perf_trace_buf memory, leading to a memory leak.
3. Reason: The code contains multiple memory leak vulnerabilities due to improper handling of memory allocation failures and missing deallocation of memory in error paths.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Memory Leak: The `mod_alias_free` function does not properly free all allocated memory, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, the `plugin_config` structures stored in `config_storage` are not freed before freeing the `config_storage` array. This can result in memory leakage.
     - Vulnerable lines: 20, 22-28
     - Reason: The `plugin_config` structures should be freed before freeing the `config_storage` array to prevent memory leaks.
   - Buffer Overflow: In the `mod_alias_physical_handler` function, there is a potential buffer overflow when calculating the `uri_len` and `uri_ptr`. The calculation does not account for the possibility of negative values, which can lead to accessing memory out of bounds.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure File Access: The code allows for potential directory traversal attacks by not properly sanitizing the requested filename in the TFTP RRQ (Read Request) packet. An attacker could manipulate the filename to access sensitive files outside the intended directory.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```c
       if (!strncmp(req_fname, ""../"", 3) ||

           return;
       }
       ```
     - Reason: The code does not adequately prevent directory traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

3. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks. Ensure that the requested filename is within the allowed directory and does not contain any path traversal sequences.

2. Vulnerability type: Format String Vulnerability
   Vulnerable lines: 22, 34, 48, 64, 82, 98, 114
   Reason: The code uses user-controlled format strings in functions like `vfprintf`, `perror`, `fatal`, `vsnprintf`, `bufadd`, `warn`, and `writefile` without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to format string vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability type: Memory Leak
   Vulnerable lines: 56, 72, 88, 104, 120
   Reason: The code allocates memory using functions like `malloc`, `realloc`, and `xmalloc` but does not free the allocated memory, leading to memory leaks.

4. Vulnerability type: Insecure File Permissions
   Vulnerable lines: 148
   Reason: The code uses insecure file permissions (0777) when creating directories in the `makedirs` function, which can lead to potential security risks.

5. Vulnerability type: Insecure File Operations
   Vulnerable lines: 166
   Reason: The code uses `fopen` with mode ""w"" in the `writefile` function, which can overwrite existing files and potentially lead to data loss or unauthorized access.

6. Vulnerability type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable lines: 148, 166
   Reason: The code does not validate user input properly in the `makedirs` and `writefile` functions, which can lead to path traversal attacks or unexpected behavior.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Use of insecure cryptographic algorithm
     - Vulnerable lines: evm_crypto.c:47, evm_crypto.c:61
     - Reason: The code uses the SHA1 algorithm for HMAC calculation, which is considered insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. It is recommended to use stronger cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3 for HMAC calculations.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Information Disclosure: The code contains potential information disclosure vulnerabilities due to the use of uninitialized variables. For example, in the `mv_read_header` function, the variables `ast` and `vst` are declared but not initialized before being used. This can lead to reading uninitialized memory, potentially leaking sensitive information.
   - Memory Leak: The code allocates memory for a string in the `var_read_string` function but does not free it before returning. This can lead to memory leaks and potential denial of service if the function is called repeatedly without freeing the allocated memory.
   - Integer Overflow: There is a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `read_table` function where the variable `count` is read from the input buffer without proper validation. This can lead to buffer overflows or other security issues.
