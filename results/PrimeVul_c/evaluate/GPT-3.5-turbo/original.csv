   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code does not perform proper input validation on the `file` parameter passed to the `fopen` function, which can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.

3. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 89
   Reason: The code reads lines from the file into the `buf` buffer without checking the length of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input line exceeds the size of the `buf` buffer (512 bytes).

4. Vulnerability Type: Insecure Data Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 123
   Reason: The code reads the key from the input file without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to insecure data handling if the key contains unexpected or malicious content.

The next execution in the loop will assign self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely.

       - Line 96: `generate_hash` function is called with the password and challenge strings.
   - Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform input validation on user inputs, such as usernames and passwords obtained from the client. This can lead to buffer overflow or injection attacks.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 126: User input from the client is directly used without proper validation.
       - Line 144: User input from the client is directly used without proper validation.
   - Use of Deprecated Functions: The code uses `getpass` function, which is deprecated and not recommended for secure password handling.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 228: Usage of `getpass` function for password input.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure cryptographic hash function, lack of input validation, and use of deprecated functions.

4. Recommendation: 
   - Replace the usage of MD4 hash function with a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
   - Implement input validation to prevent buffer overflow and injection attacks.
   - Replace the usage of `getpass` function with a more secure alternative for password input handling.","CWE: CWE-354

A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE: CVE-2021-31535

LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.

CVE: CVE-2020-5260

Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /proc/pid/syscall functionality of Linux Kernel 5.1 Stable and 5.4.66. More specifically, this issue has been introduced in v5.1-rc4 (commit 631b7abacd02b88f4b0795c08b54ad4fc3e7c7c0) and is still present in v5.10-rc4, so it’s likely that all versions in between are affected. An attacker can read /proc/pid/syscall to trigger this vulnerability, which leads to the kernel leaking memory contents.
