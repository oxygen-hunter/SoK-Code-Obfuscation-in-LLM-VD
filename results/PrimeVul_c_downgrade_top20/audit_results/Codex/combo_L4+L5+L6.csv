2. - `print-vqp.c:64` — Out-of-bounds read (DoS): `process_items()` casts `tptr` to `struct vqp_obj_tlv_t` and reads `obj_type`/`obj_length` before verifying that at least `sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t)` bytes remain. A truncated or intentionally short packet can force the parser to read past the capture buffer, causing a crash.

2. - Vulnerability: Path traversal / directory escape; Location: `compose_path` in `uftpd.c:47`; Reason: When not chrooted, the code only checks `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))` on the pre-normalized string. Inputs such as `/srv/ftp/../../etc/passwd` keep the `home` prefix in `dir`, so the check passes while `realpath` resolves `rpath` outside the FTP root, letting an attacker escape the intended sandbox.  
   - Vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow; Location: `compose_path` in `uftpd.c:28`; Reason: `memmove(dir + len, dir, strlen(dir) + 1)` copies `strlen(dir)+1` bytes into `dir + len` without verifying that `strlen(dir) + len < PATH_MAX`. With an attacker-controlled path near `PATH_MAX` bytes, the copy overruns the `dir` stack buffer by `len` bytes, enabling denial of service or code execution when the server runs without chroot.

  - Stack exhaustion → denial of service (combo_L4+L5+L6/69_nsc.c:23-67): nsc_decode_recurse processes every pixel via recursion without 
    any depth cap; for typical RDP frame sizes it creates millions of nested calls, overflowing the thread stack and crashing the process    on attacker-supplied frame dimensions.                                                                                               
  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L4+L5+L6/69_nsc.c:93): While expanding RLE data the attacker controls len; when len > left, the unsigned 
    subtraction left - len underflows and FillMemory(out, len, …) writes past the originalSize buffer, enabling remote code execution or 
    a crash.                                                                                                                             
  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L4+L5+L6/69_nsc.c:72): The recursion base case always copies four bytes *((UINT32*)out) = *((UINT32*)in);
    even when fewer than four bytes remain (left < 4), corrupting adjacent heap memory and allowing a crafted stream to crash the        
    decoder.

  - Denial of service – integer overflow (combo_L4+L5+L6/71_riff.c:275): Attacker-controlled chunk_header.ckSize (uint32_t) is stored    
    in signed int bytes_to_copy after (ckSize + 1) & ~1L; values ≥0x80000000 wrap negative, so when cast back to size_t for malloc the   
    function attempts an absurd allocation, exhausting memory or failing.                                                                
  - Denial of service – unchecked allocation (combo_L4+L5+L6/71_riff.c:276-287): The result of malloc is never validated. If the         
    oversized allocation above (or low memory) yields buff == NULL, the subsequent DoReadFile/WavpackAddWrapper calls dereference NULL,  
    immediately crashing the process on malicious RIFF data.

- Stack-based buffer overflow (lines 10-11, 18-21): `recursiveConcat` repeatedly calls `strcat` on the fixed 255-byte `cmnd` buffer with unbounded user-controlled argv data, so long inputs can overwrite the stack while the process runs with UID 0.
- OS command injection (lines 21, 27): User-supplied argv values are concatenated directly into `cmnd` and executed via `system`, allowing shell metacharacters to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.
