2. - Type: Insecure dynamic library loading (DLL hijacking); Lines: `code.c:44`; Reason: `load_and_run_vqp_print` loads `./libvqp.so` via `dlopen` using a relative path, so an attacker who can drop a malicious library in the working directory can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process.
   - Type: Insecure dynamic library loading (DLL hijacking); Lines: `script.py:3`; Reason: The Python wrapper calls `ctypes.CDLL('./libvqp.so')`, again trusting a relative path that can be replaced by a malicious library, leading to arbitrary native code execution when the module is imported or used.

2. - Path traversal / directory escape — `compose_path`:34-58 — The code prepends `home` to the user-supplied path (which may contain `..`) and later validates location with `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))`. Because `dir` is never canonicalized before that comparison, any `..` segments keep the string beginning with `home`, while `realpath()` resolves them to an escaped location (e.g. `/srv/ftp/../../etc/passwd` → `/etc/passwd`). When the daemon runs without a successful `chroot()`, an attacker can traverse out of the intended FTP root and access arbitrary filesystem paths.

  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L8/69_nsc.c:134): The RLE decoder subtracts the attacker-controlled len from left without verifying that 
    the run fits. When len > left, the unsigned decrement underflows and FillMemory(out, len, …) writes past the originalSize buffer,    
    enabling remote code execution or a crash.                                                                                           
  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L8/69_nsc.c:145): After the loop the code unconditionally copies four bytes *((UINT32*)out) =            
    *((UINT32*)in);; if the overflow above has already advanced out beyond the buffer end, or if fewer than four bytes remain, this write
    also lands out of bounds, compounding heap corruption.

  - Denial of service – integer overflow (combo_L8/71_riff.c:290): chunk_header.ckSize is attacker-controlled uint32_t. After (ckSize +  
    1) & ~1L, it is stored in signed int bytes_to_copy; values ≥0x80000000 wrap negative, so casting back to size_t for malloc requests  
    an absurd allocation, exhausting memory or failing immediately.                                                                      
  - Denial of service – unchecked allocation (combo_L8/71_riff.c:291-301): The result of malloc is never checked. If the oversized       
    allocation above (or low memory) yields buff == NULL, the subsequent DoReadFile/WavpackAddWrapper calls dereference that NULL        
    pointer, crashing the program on malicious RIFF input.

- YES – the code is vulnerable.

**Findings**
- Buffer Overflow – code lines 11-16: builds the command in a fixed 255-byte buffer and appends user-controlled strings with `libc.strcat` without length checks, allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory.
- Command Injection – code lines 14-22: concatenates raw command-line arguments into the command and executes them via `libc.system`, enabling arbitrary shell command execution (amplified by the preceding `setuid(0)` call, which would run injected commands with root privileges).
