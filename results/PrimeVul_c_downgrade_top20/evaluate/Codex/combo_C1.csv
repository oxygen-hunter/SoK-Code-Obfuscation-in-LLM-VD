- Out-of-bounds read – `print-vqp.c:82` – `vqp_obj_tlv = (const struct vqp_obj_tlv_t *)tptr;` and the subsequent `EXTRACT_32BITS/EXTRACT_16BITS` dereference the TLV header before confirming that at least `sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t)` bytes remain (`tlen` may be shorter). A truncated or malicious packet can force the parser to read past the capture buffer, causing a crash (DoS) or data disclosure.

2. Path traversal / escape from FTP root – `compose_path()` (`dir` prefix check), lines ~24-52: the code validates `dir` with `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))` before canonicalizing it. An attacker can supply `../` segments (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`); `dir` still begins with `home`, so the check passes, but `realpath()` resolves the path outside the FTP root. This lets a client access arbitrary files whenever the daemon is not already chrooted.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

Heap-based buffer overflow — data/PrimeVul_c_downgrade_top20/original/69_nsc.c (line 123), data/PrimeVul_c_downgrade_top20/original/69_nsc.c (line 127) — when the run-length marker is 0xFF, len is read as a 32-bit attacker-controlled value and is never checked against the remaining left size before FillMemory(out, len, value);, so crafted input can force len > left and overflow the heap output buffer.
Out-of-bounds read/write — data/PrimeVul_c_downgrade_top20/original/69_nsc.c (line 138) — after the RLE loop the code blindly copies 4 bytes with *((UINT32*)out) = *((UINT32*)in); even when fewer than 4 bytes remain, which overruns the destination plane (and reads past the compressed source) whenever the plane size is not a multiple of 4.

2. Integer overflow (heap exploitation vector) — riff.c (line 233) — chunk_header.ckSize is 32-bit unsigned but assigned to signed int bytes_to_copy = (chunk_header.ckSize + 1) & ~1L;. Crafted chunk sizes ≥ 0x80000000 wrap negative, so the subsequent allocation and read operate on a size implicitly converted to a huge unsigned value, leading to excessive allocation/DoS or potential heap corruption.
Null pointer dereference / DoS — riff.c (line 234) — the result of malloc(bytes_to_copy) is used immediately without a NULL check; with the oversized request above, malloc returns NULL and DoReadFile() / WavpackAddWrapper() dereference it, crashing the process.

CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
