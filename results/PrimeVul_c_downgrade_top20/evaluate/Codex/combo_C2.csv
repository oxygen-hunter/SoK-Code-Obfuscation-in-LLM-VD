The loop only verifies that `tlen > 0` before accessing the TLV header, so a packet whose remaining length is smaller than `sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t)` triggers reads past the captured buffer, leading to memory disclosure or a crash before `ND_TCHECK2` can run.

2. - Type: Path traversal (`uftpd.c:73-77`) – the post-resolution check uses `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))` on the non-canonical `dir` buffer, so crafted inputs with `..` keep the `home` prefix while `realpath` resolves outside the FTP root, allowing traversal beyond the intended directory.  
   - Type: Improper privilege drop (`uftpd.c:268-282`) – failures from `setegid`/`seteuid` only trigger warnings; execution continues with root privileges and `privs_dropped` is set to 1, so later sessions never retry dropping, leaving the process running as root.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

        context->width * context->height * 4 uses 32-bit arithmetic on attacker-controlled width/height, so large

        undersized buffer, overflowing heap memory.
      - Heap-based buffer overflow in RLE decompressor (combo_C2/69_nsc.c:137-154): The run-length len read from the
        compressed stream is never checked against the remaining output left, so an attacker can supply an arbitrary
        large value. FillMemory(out, len, value) then writes past the allocated plane buffer, corrupting heap memory.

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

• 1. YES
      - Integer overflow / unchecked allocation (combo_C2/71_riff.c:286-297): bytes_to_copy is calculated from the chunk
        size in the file (chunk_header.ckSize) and then stored in a signed int. For attacker-supplied sizes ≥ 0x80000000
        this wraps to a negative value, so the subsequent malloc(bytes_to_copy) request is implicitly converted to
        a huge unsigned size and fails, leaving buff == NULL. The code then still calls DoReadFile(infile, buff,
        bytes_to_copy, …) and WavpackAddWrapper(wpc, buff, bytes_to_copy) with that null pointer and negative length,
        which dereferences NULL (or interprets the length as a massive unsigned value). A crafted RIFF chunk therefore
        triggers an immediate crash (denial of service).

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

   - Command Injection / Privilege Escalation — `main:28`, `main:29`, `main:37`, `main:38`; untrusted arguments are concatenated into a shell command and executed via `system` after `setuid(UID)` elevates to root, letting attackers run arbitrary commands with root privileges.
