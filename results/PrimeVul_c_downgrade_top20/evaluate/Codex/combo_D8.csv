2. - Out-of-bounds Read: `vqp.c:117`, `vqp.c:118`, `vqp.c:119`; the code casts `tptr` to `struct vqp_obj_tlv_t` and immediately calls `EXTRACT_32BITS`/`EXTRACT_16BITS` on `obj_type` and `obj_length` without first confirming that at least `sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t)` bytes remain. A truncated or malicious packet can make `tlen` smaller than that header size, so these macros read past the capture buffer and crash the dissector.

2. - Directory traversal (`compose_path`, lines 31-57): The post-`realpath` guard checks `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))`, but `dir` still contains the uncanonicalized string (e.g. `/srv/ftp/../../etc/passwd`). Attackers can supply paths starting with the configured prefix followed by `..` segments (such as `../../etc/passwd`), so the prefix comparison passes while the normalized path (`rpath`) resolves outside the intended root, letting them read/write arbitrary filesystem locations when the service runs without a chroot.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

  - Heap buffer overflow via integer underflow (combo_D8/69_nsc.c:90-118): During RLE expansion the attacker controls len. When len      
    > left, the unsigned decrement left -= len underflows, the loop keeps running, and FillMemory(out, len, value) writes past the       
    originalSize output buffer, enabling denial of service or code execution.

    *((UINT32*)in); even if the loop already exhausted the originalSize bytes; when the previous underflow occurred, this write also     
    lands out of bounds, compounding the overflow.

    ~1L masking it is stored in signed int bytes_to_copy. Values ≥0x80000000 wrap negative, so when implicitly converted back to size_t  
    for malloc the call requests an absurd size, exhausting memory or failing immediately.                                               
  - Denial of service – unchecked allocation (combo_D8/71_riff.c:287-298): The result of malloc is never validated. When the overflow    
    above (or low-memory conditions) yields buff == NULL, the subsequent DoReadFile(infile, buff, …) dereferences NULL, crashing the     
    process on hostile RIFF input.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
