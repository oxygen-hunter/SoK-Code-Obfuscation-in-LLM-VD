2. - Out-of-bounds read — `code.c:81` — The loop only checks `OXA9B8C7D > 0` before casting `OX9B8A7C6D` to `struct OX6F5E4D3C` and calling `EXTRACT_32BITS`/`EXTRACT_16BITS`. If fewer than six bytes remain in the capture buffer, these reads walk past the end of the packet, enabling a crash/DoS with a truncated VQP payload.

2. - Type: Stack-based buffer overflow; Vulnerable lines: `OX3E2D9F1A` block `if (!OX7B4DF339) { ... memmove(OX1F2E3D4C + OXA9B8C7D, ...); memcpy(OX1F2E3D4C, home, ...); }`; Reason: the code shifts the assembled path by `strlen(home)` without checking that `strlen(current_path) + strlen(home) < PATH_MAX`, so a long client-supplied path (already at the `PATH_MAX` limit) causes `memmove`/`memcpy` to write past the stack buffer.  
   - Type: Directory traversal (path escape); Vulnerable lines: `OX3E2D9F1A` check `if (!OX7B4DF339 && strncmp(OX1F2E3D4C, home, strlen(home)))`; Reason: the prefix validation is performed on the non-canonical buffer `OX1F2E3D4C`, while the normalized path returned to callers is `OX4A5B6C7D`. Attackers can supply segments like `../` that keep the unchecked string starting with `home` but make `realpath()` resolve outside the FTP root, breaking the intended confinement.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L1/69_nsc.c:90-106): The RLE decoder subtracts the attacker-controlled run length OX1B3C9F0A from        
    OX3C9F0A1B without checking that the run fits, so when OX1B3C9F0A > OX3C9F0A1B the unsigned decrement underflows and FillMemory      
    writes past the originalSize output buffer, enabling denial of service or code execution.
  - Heap buffer overflow (combo_L1/69_nsc.c:114): After the loop the code unconditionally copies four bytes *((UINT32*)OX4A3F8B7E) =     
    *((UINT32*)OX6B9E2F7A);; if the overflow above advanced OX4A3F8B7E beyond the buffer end, this final write further corrupts heap     
    memory.

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

    signed int OX6C7A5F3E after (ckSize + 1) & ~1L. Values ≥0x80000000 wrap negative; when implicitly cast back to size_t for malloc, the    call requests an enormous buffer, exhausting memory or failing immediately.
  - Denial of service – unchecked allocation (combo_L1/71_riff.c:271-283): The code never verifies malloc’s return. If the oversized     
    allocation above (or low memory) yields OX2E3D6A7F == NULL, the subsequent DoReadFile and WavpackAddWrapper dereference NULL,

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

2. - Vulnerability Type: Command Injection; Vulnerable Lines: snippet.c:12-20; Reason: User-supplied arguments are concatenated into a shell command and executed with `system`, so any shell metacharacters in `argv` let an attacker execute arbitrary commands (potentially as root after the `setuid(0)` call).
   - Vulnerability Type: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow; Vulnerable Lines: snippet.c:9-13; Reason: The fixed-size `OX9B8C7A6D[255]` buffer is filled with `strcpy`/`strcat` without bounds checks, allowing long arguments to overflow the stack and hijack control flow.
