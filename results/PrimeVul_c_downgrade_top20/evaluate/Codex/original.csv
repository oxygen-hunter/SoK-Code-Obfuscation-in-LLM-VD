2. - Type: Out-of-bounds read / Denial-of-Service; vulnerable code: `vqp_print()` at the TLV parsing loop (`vqp_obj_tlv = ...`, `vqp_obj_type = EXTRACT_32BITS(...)`, `vqp_obj_len = EXTRACT_16BITS(...)`).  
     Reason: the code reads the TLV header fields before verifying that `tlen` still contains at least `sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t)` bytes. A crafted packet with fewer than six bytes remaining will make these dereferences step past the captured buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read and likely crash.

2. Directory traversal — `common.c:56`, `common.c:83` — `compose_path()` prepends `home` to the user-supplied path, but the post-check `strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))` is performed on the pre-normalized `dir` string instead of the canonicalized `realpath` result in `rpath`. An attacker can supply inputs like `../../etc/passwd` so that `realpath()` resolves outside the FTP root while `dir` still begins with `home`, allowing reads/writes outside the intended root.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

    the overflow above (or a short buffer) leaves fewer than four bytes remaining, this write goes out of bounds, further corrupting

  - Denial of service – integer overflow (original/71_riff.c:288): Attacker-controlled chunk_header.ckSize (uint32_t) is stored in signed    int bytes_to_copy after (ckSize + 1) & ~1L; values ≥0x80000000 wrap negative. When cast back to size_t for malloc, the code attempts 
    an absurd allocation, leading to allocator failure or resource exhaustion.                                                           
  - Denial of service – unchecked allocation (original/71_riff.c:289-299): The result of malloc is never validated. If the oversized     
    allocation above (or low memory) yields buff == NULL, the subsequent DoReadFile/WavpackAddWrapper calls dereference the NULL pointer,
    crashing the process on malicious RIFF input.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
