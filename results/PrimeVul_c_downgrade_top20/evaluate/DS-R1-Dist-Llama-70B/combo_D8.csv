2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `vqp_obj_len` is used without sufficient bounds checking, specifically in the `switch` statement and when accessing `tptr`.
     - **Reason:** The code does not properly validate that `vqp_obj_len` does not exceed the remaining data length (`tlen`). This could lead to buffer overflow when processing the object data, potentially causing a crash or allowing execution of arbitrary code.

   - **Improper Bounds Checking**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The loop condition and `ND_TCHECK2` usage may not adequately prevent accessing beyond the buffer when `vqp_obj_len` is larger than `tlen`.
     - **Reason:** Insufficient checks could result in reading beyond the allocated buffer, leading to undefined behavior or security exploits.

2. The code has multiple security vulnerabilities:

   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines using `static char rpath[PATH_MAX];` in `compose_path`  
     **Reason**: The use of a static buffer in `compose_path` introduces a data race condition in multi-threaded environments, potentially leading to information leaks or unexpected behavior.

   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `seteuid` and `setegid` are called without proper error checking  
     **Reason**: Failing to ensure that privilege dropping functions succeed could result in the process retaining higher privileges than intended, increasing the attack surface.

   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Use of `access(home, W_OK)` after privilege dropping  
     **Reason**: The `access` function checks permissions based on the real UID,","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath().

69_nsc.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES

2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Buffer Overflow**: The `nsc_rle_decode` function does not properly validate the length of data being decompressed, which can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the output buffer. Specifically, when handling run-length encoded data, the function uses `len` without ensuring it doesn't exceed the remaining space in `out`, potentially causing memory corruption.

   - **Vulnerable Lines**:
     - Lines in `nsc_rle_decode` where `FillMemory` is called without bounds checking on `len`.

3. **Reason**: The lack of bounds checking on the `len` variable in `nsc_rle_decode` allows for a buffer overflow, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow in memcpy (ParseRiffHeaderConfig function):**
     - **Vulnerable Line:** `memcpy (&riff_chunk_header, fourcc, 4);`
     - **Reason:** The code uses `memcpy` to copy 4 bytes from `fourcc` into `riff_chunk_header.ckID`. If `fourcc` is not properly validated, it could lead to a buffer overflow, although in this context, since `fourcc` is a 4-byte string, the risk is mitigated.

   - **Unchecked malloc (ParseRiffHeaderConfig function):**
     - **Vulnerable Line:** `char *buff = malloc (bytes_to_copy);`
     - **Reason:** The code allocates memory using `malloc` without checking if the allocation was successful, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if `malloc` fails.

   - **Improper Error Handling for DoReadFile (Multiple locations):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Various instances of `DoReadFile` without proper error checking.
     - **Reason:** The code sometimes fails to check the return value of `DoReadFile`, which could result in reading beyond the end of the file or processing invalid data, potentially causing crashes or information leaks.

   - **Potential Integer Overflow in total_riff_bytes Calculation (WriteRiffHeader function):**
     - **Vulnerable Line:** `total_riff_bytes = sizeof (riffhdr) + wavhdrsize + sizeof (datahdr) + ((total_data_bytes + 1) & ~(int64_t)1);`
     - **Reason:** The calculation could overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value for `int64_t`, leading to incorrect chunk sizes.

   - **Unchecked Return Values for DoWriteFile (WriteRiffHeader function):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Multiple instances of `DoWriteFile` without checking the return value.
     - **Reason:** Failing to check if writes are successful could lead to incomplete file writes without proper error handling.

   - **Improper Use of strncpy (Multiple locations):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** `strncpy (riffhdr.ckID, do_rf64 ? ""RF64"" : ""RIFF"", sizeof (riffhdr.ckID));","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `strcat(cmnd, argv[cnt]);` is used (lines 21-23).
     - **Reason:** The code uses `strcat()` in a loop without checking the length of `cmnd`, which can lead to a buffer overflow since `cmnd` is a fixed-size array of 255 characters. This allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by providing overly long command-line arguments.

   - **Command Injection Vulnerability:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line where `system(cmnd);` is called (line 30).
     - **Reason:** The program constructs a command string from user-supplied arguments (argv) and executes it using `system()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, especially if the arguments contain malicious input, leading to command injection attacks.

3. **N/A** (Since vulnerabilities were found)

4. **N/A** (Since vulnerabilities were found)

**Summary:**
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow and command injection attacks due to unsafe string handling and the use of `system()`. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, especially dangerous since the program runs as root.","CWE: CWE-74
