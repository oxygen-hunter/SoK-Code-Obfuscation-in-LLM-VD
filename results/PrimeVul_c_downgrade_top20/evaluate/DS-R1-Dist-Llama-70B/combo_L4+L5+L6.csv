2. **Vulnerabilities Found:**

   - **Static Buffer in compose_path()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line where `static char rpath[PATH_MAX];` is declared.
     - **Reason:** The use of a static buffer can lead to data races in multi-threaded environments, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

   - **Buffer Overflow in compose_abspath()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** `strlcpy(cwd, ctrl->cwd, sizeof(cwd));`
     - **Reason:** The size parameter might be larger than the destination buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

   - **Improper Fork Handling in new_session()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The `fork()` call without proper error handling.
     - **Reason:** If `fork()` fails, the program may not handle it correctly, leading to inconsistent states.

   - **Missing Privilege Drop Error Handling in new_session()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Calls to `initgroups()`, `setegid()`, and `seteuid()` without checking their return values.
     - **Reason:** Failure to drop privileges properly could leave the process with elevated rights.

   - **Null Pointer Dereference in del_session()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Accessing `ctrl` members without a null check.
     - **Reason:** Passing a null `ctrl` could cause a segmentation fault.

   - **Potential Buffer Overflow in compose_path()**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Use of `strlcat` on `rpath`.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath().

2. **Vulnerabilities Found:**

   - **Stack Overflow Due to Deep Recursion:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
       - `nsc_decode_recurse` function (recursive calls without stack guard)
       - `nsc_rle_decode_recurse` function (recursive calls without stack guard)
     - **Reason:** Both functions use recursion without checking the maximum recursion depth, which can lead to stack overflow, potentially causing crashes or allowing arbitrary code execution, especially with large input sizes.

   - **Potential Out-of-Bounds Access:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
       - `nsc_decode_recurse` function where `yplane`, `coplane`, `cgplane`, and `aplane` are accessed without bounds checking.
     - **Reason:** The function accesses memory based on `y` and `x` without ensuring that these indices are within the allocated buffer's bounds, which could lead to information leaks or crashes if the indices are miscalculated.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Replace recursive functions with iterative approaches to prevent stack overflow.
   - Add bounds checking in decoding functions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The code contains potential security vulnerabilities related to stack overflow and possible out-of-bounds memory access, which need to be addressed to ensure secure operation.","CWE: CWE-787

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow/Integer Overflow:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** In the else clause of `ParseRiffHeaderConfig`, the code calculates `bytes_to_copy` as `(chunk_header.ckSize + 1) & ~1L`. If `chunk_header.ckSize` is very large, this could cause an integer overflow, leading to a small buffer allocation followed by a large read, potentially causing a buffer overflow or crash.
     
   - **Memory Exhaustion:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Same as above. Allocating memory based on `chunk_header.ckSize` without proper bounds checking could lead to excessive memory usage, causing a denial of service.
     
   - **Potential Stack Overflow:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The `read_table_length` function uses recursion. If `ds64_chunk.tableLength` is excessively large,","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines using `strcpy(cmnd, CMD);` and the `strcat` calls within `recursiveConcat`.
     - **Reason:** The functions `strcpy` and `strcat` do not perform bounds checking, leading to potential buffer overflow when `CMD` or concatenated arguments exceed the size of `cmnd` (255 characters). This could allow arbitrary code execution, especially dangerous as the program runs with elevated privileges.

   - **Command Injection Vulnerability**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The use of `system(cmnd)` after constructing `cmnd` from user-provided arguments.
     - **Reason:** User input is directly inserted into the command string, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, which are executed with root privileges due to `setuid(UID)`.

**Summary:** The code is vulnerable due to buffer overflow and command injection issues, both of which can lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.","CWE: CWE-74
