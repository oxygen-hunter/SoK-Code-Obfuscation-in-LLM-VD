35_print-vqp.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   - **Stack Overflow**: Lines 14-16 in `vm_push` function. The condition `if (vm->sp < MAX_STACK_SIZE - 1)` allows `sp` to reach `MAX_STACK_SIZE`, causing an overflow.  
   - **Memory Access**: Lines 52-53 in `vm_run` for `LOAD` and `STORE` instructions. Using the next instruction's value as a memory address can lead to out-of-bounds access.  

2. **Reason**: The stack overflow occurs because the condition in `vm_push` incorrectly allows `sp` to reach the maximum stack size, potentially causing a crash. Additionally, using the next instruction's value as a memory address without bounds checking can lead to memory","CWE: CWE-125

63_common.c,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **Stack Overflow Vulnerability**  
     - **Lines:** `push(vm, value)` and `case ADD`, `case SUB`  
     - **Reason:** The code does not check the stack size before pushing values. This can cause a stack overflow when the stack is full.  
   - **Uncontrolled Program Counter (JMP and JZ)**  
     - **Lines:** `case JMP` and `case JZ`  
     - **Reason:** The `JMP` instruction allows jumping to any address in the program, and `JZ` can jump based on user-controlled data, leading to potential code execution or denial of service.  
3. **Reason:** The code lacks stack bounds checking and has uncontrolled jumps, which can be exploited for security issues.","CWE: CWE-22

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

127_chgdbmailusers.c,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities:

1. **Command Injection**: The program does not sanitize the `argv` array, allowing malicious arguments to be pushed onto the stack and potentially executed via the `system` function.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The `setuid` function is called without proper validation, allowing an attacker to modify the user ID.
3. **Missing Bounds Checking**: The VM lacks checks to prevent stack and code memory overflows, which could lead to crashes or unintended behavior.
