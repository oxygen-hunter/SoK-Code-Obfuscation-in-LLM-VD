63_common.c,"The code has a potential security vulnerability in the `compose_abspath` function where the `cwd` buffer may not be large enough, leading to buffer overflow or incorrect path handling. 

1. **Vulnerable Function**: `compose_abspath`
2. **Vulnerable Lines**: 
   - Line where `cwd` is declared: `char cwd[sizeof(ctrl->cwd)];`
   - Line where `strlcpy(cwd, ctrl->cwd, sizeof(cwd));` is called.
3. **Reason**: The `cwd` buffer is initialized with `sizeof(ctrl->cwd)`, but if `ctrl->cwd` is larger than `PATH_MAX`, this can cause a buffer overflow or incorrect path composition, potentially leading to security issues like path traversal.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable**: YES
2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Buffer Overflow**: Lines 1 and 3 in `compose_abspath` function.
   - **Incorrect Path Handling**: Same lines, leading to potential security issues.
3. **Reason**: The `cwd` buffer may not be large enough, risking buffer overflow or incorrect path handling, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-22

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath().

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer Overflow, Memory Management, Invalid Pixel Format Handling  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**:  
     - `nsc_stream_initialize` (Reading 20 bytes without size check)  
     - `nsc_rle_decode` (Potential buffer overflow in the decoding loop)  
     - `nsc_context_free` (Potential double-free or invalid memory access)  
     - `nsc_process_message` (Missing bounds checking when reading from the stream)  
     - `nsc_context_set_pixel_format` (Missing validation for pixel format)  
   - **Reason**: The code lacks proper input validation and memory management, which can lead to buffer overflows, memory leaks, or incorrect pixel format handling, potentially allowing attackers to cause crashes or information leaks.

71_riff.c,"The code appears to be handling file operations with some error checking, but there are potential issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.

1. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Potential Buffer Overflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `DoReadFile` and `DoWriteFile` are used without proper bounds checking.
   - **Reason:** The functions `DoReadFile` and `DoWriteFile` handle file operations without ensuring that the buffer sizes are within limits, which could lead to buffer overflows if not properly managed.

2. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Integer Overflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Calculations involving `total_riff_bytes` and `total_samples` in `WriteRiffHeader`.
   - **Reason:** Using 32-bit integers for large values could cause integer overflow, leading to incorrect header generation or corruption.

3. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** The loop writing `table_length` CS64 chunks without a limit.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
