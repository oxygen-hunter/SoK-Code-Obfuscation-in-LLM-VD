63_common.c,"The code contains several potential security vulnerabilities and issues:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The variable `OX7B4DF339` is declared as a global integer and used in multiple functions. This can lead to thread safety issues and unintended side effects if not properly managed across different parts of the code.

2. **Path Handling Risks**: The use of `realpath` in functions like `OX3E2D9F1A` and `OX9C8D7E6F` can expose internal file paths and may allow path traversal attacks if not properly validated. Additionally, the code constructs paths without sufficient validation, which could lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities.

3. **Buffer Usage**: The static buffer `OX1F2E3D4C` is used for storing paths without proper bounds","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"The code contains potential security vulnerabilities related to improper memory management and possible buffer overflows. Specifically:

1. **Memory Leak Risks**: Functions like `OX1B3C9F0A` and `OX3C9F0A1B` use `realloc` without checking if the allocation failed, which could lead to memory leaks or crashes if the function fails.

2. **Buffer Overflow Risks**: Functions that handle streams and buffers, such as `OX4A3F8B7E`, may not properly check buffer sizes, potentially causing overflows.

3. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables could lead to race conditions in multi-threaded environments if not properly synchronized.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak**: In `OX1B3C9F0A`, `realloc` is called without checking the return value, risking a crash if memory allocation fails.
- **Memory Leak**: In `OX3C9F0A1B`, a `free` is called without checking if the pointer is null, which could cause a crash.
- **Potential Buffer Overflow**: Functions handling streams may not check buffer sizes adequately, posing a risk.

**Conclusion**: The code has several areas that could lead to memory leaks or buffer overflows, especially in environments where these functions are called without proper context or synchronization.","CWE: CWE-787

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
