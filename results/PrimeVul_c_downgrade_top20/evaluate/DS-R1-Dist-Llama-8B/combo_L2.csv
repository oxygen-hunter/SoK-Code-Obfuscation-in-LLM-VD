The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().

63_common.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Path Handling Vulnerability  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**:  
     - `compose_path` function: The loop using `strstr` and `memmove` can lead to infinite loops or buffer overflows if the input path contains malicious content.  
     - `compose_abspath` function: Potential insecure handling of paths that may not correctly validate or sanitize user-provided paths.  
   - **Reason**: These functions may allow path traversal or directory traversal attacks due to improper path validation and manipulation, potentially exposing sensitive directories or files.

2. **Explanation**:  
   The `compose_path` function contains a loop that repeatedly processes paths containing consecutive slashes (`//`). This could be exploited to create malicious paths that bypass security measures or cause the server to access unintended directories. Additionally, the `compose_abspath` function may not correctly handle cases where the provided path could lead to directory traversal, potentially exposing the server to accessing restricted areas of the filesystem.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

2. **Reason:** The code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities upon initial analysis. It properly handles memory allocation and initialization, and the primary functions appear to be correctly managing resources without evident buffer overflows or uninitialized variable issues.

CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

71_riff.c,"The code contains potential security vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows and improper handling of fixed-size structures. Specifically, the functions `ParseRiffHeaderConfig` and `WriteRiffHeader` do not adequately check for buffer overflows when reading and writing chunks, which could lead to memory corruption or overflow issues.

1. **Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow in Chunk Reading**
   - **Lines:** In `ParseRiffHeaderConfig`, the code reads chunks using `DoReadFile` without ensuring that the read data fits within the expected buffer size, potentially causing buffer overflow.
   
2. **Vulnerability 2: Buffer Overflow in Chunk Writing**
   - **Lines:** In `WriteRiffHeader`, the code writes chunks without verifying that the data fits within the allocated buffer, leading to potential overflow risks.

**Reasoning:**
- The code reads and writes chunks using fixed-size structures without validating the input data length, which can be exploited by malicious inputs to cause memory overflows.
- This can result in crashes or corrupted data if the input exceeds expected sizes, leading","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

1. **Vulnerability Type:**
   - **Shell Injection**
   - **Improper Privilege Handling**

2. **Vulnerable Lines:**
   - **Lines 8-10:** The use of `strcat` without sanitization allows shell injection.
   - **Line 14:** Using `setuid(0)` grants root privileges without proper checks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Shell Injection:** The code constructs a command by appending user input without sanitization, allowing malicious arguments to be executed as part of the command string.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Using `setuid(UID)` with `UID=0` grants root access, which can be exploited if the command is manipulated through shell injection.

YES. The code has shell injection and improper privilege handling vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-74
