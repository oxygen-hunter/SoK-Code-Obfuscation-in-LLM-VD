63_common.c,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities, primarily related to buffer overflows and improper bounds checking.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Stack Overflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `push` and `pop` functions in `run_vm`.
   - **Reason**: The stack (`vm->stack`) is fixed at `MAX_STACK_SIZE`, but there's no check to prevent exceeding this limit, leading to potential overflow.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Program Array Overflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `STORE` instruction in `run_vm`.
   - **Reason**: The `STORE` instruction writes to `vm->program` using a value from the stack without checking if it exceeds `MAX_PROGRAM_SIZE`.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Fixed Address Usage
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `compile_compose_path` and `compile_open_socket` functions.
   - **Reason**: The use of fixed addresses (e.g., 10 and 20) in the compiled programs can lead to running beyond the intended program bounds, causing undefined behavior.

These issues can result in crashes, undefined behavior, or potential security risks if untrusted code is executed.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable**: YES
2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Type**: Stack Overflow
     - **Lines**: `push` and `pop` functions in `run_vm`.
     - **Reason**: No bounds checking on the stack.
   - **Type**: Program Array Overflow
     - **Lines**: `STORE` instruction in `run_vm`.
     - **Reason**: Writes to `vm->program` without size check.
   - **Type**: Fixed Address Usage
     - **Lines**: `compile_compose_path` and `compile_open_socket`.
     - **Reason**: Risk of exceeding program bounds.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"The code is vulnerable to several security issues due to the lack of bounds checking and proper validation in key operations.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer Overflow in Stack Operations
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `push` and `pop` functions are called (e.g., in `run` function).
   - **Reason**: The stack (`vm->stack`) is an array of size `STACK_SIZE`, but there's no check to ensure that `sp` doesn't exceed this limit. This can cause a buffer overflow when too many elements are pushed or popped.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer Overflow in Memory Operations
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `LOAD` and `STORE` operations are performed.
   - **Reason**: The `LOAD` and `STORE` operations use an address (`addr`) from the code without checking if it's within the valid range (0 to `STACK_SIZE - 1`). This can lead to accessing memory outside the allocated array, causing undefined behavior.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Uncontrolled Jump in Program Counter
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `JMP` and `JZ` operations are performed.
   - **Reason**: The `JMP` and `JZ` operations set `vm->pc` to a value from the code without validating if it's within the bounds of the `code` array. This can cause the VM to access invalid memory locations, leading to crashes or undefined behavior.

4. **Vulnerability Type**: Stack Underflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `pop` is called without ensuring the stack is not empty.
   - **Reason**: The `pop` function doesn't check if `sp` is at least 0 before accessing `vm->stack[vm->sp]`. If the stack is empty, this can cause accessing invalid memory, leading to a crash.

These vulnerabilities make the code susceptible to crashes, data corruption, and potential exploitation if untrusted data is used as input.","CWE: CWE-787

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
