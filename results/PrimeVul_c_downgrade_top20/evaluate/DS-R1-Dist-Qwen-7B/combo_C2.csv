35_print-vqp.c,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Buffer Overflow in Print Statements:** The code uses functions like `ipaddr_string`, `safeputs`, `etheraddr_string`, and `print_unknown_data` without proper bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input data exceeds expected lengths.
   - **Unknown Data Handling:** The `print_unknown_data` function might not handle all possible data types correctly, potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
3. **Reason:** The code lacks explicit checks for buffer overflows in print statements, which could allow uncontrolled data injection or corruption if the input data is too large.
4. **Not Sure:** Without more context on how the data is handled after printing, it's unclear if this could be exploited.","CWE: CWE-125

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Insufficient File Permissions:** The `compose_path()` and `compose_abspath()` functions do not verify that the `chrooted` variable is set correctly, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
   - **Unchecked `chroot()` Calls:** The code calls `chroot()` without ensuring the user has the necessary permissions, risking unauthorized directory access.
   - **Socket Reuse Without Validation:** `open_socket()` uses `SO_REUSEADDR` but lacks checks to prevent improper reuse.
   - **Inactivity Callback Permissions:** `inactivity_cb()` does not validate user privileges, risking denial of service.
   - **Missing Resource Checks:** `del_session()` does not ensure all resources are properly closed, leading to potential leaks.
3. **Reason:** The code lacks sufficient checks for file permissions, socket management, and resource cleanup, increasing the risk of security breaches.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"The code provided has several potential security vulnerabilities. Here's a detailed analysis and suggested fixes:

### Vulnerabilities:

1. **NULL Context Pointer:**
   - **Issue:** The code does not check if the context pointer is `NULL` after calling `nsc_context_new()`. If `context` is `NULL`, accessing any member of the struct will cause a crash.
   - **Fix:** Add a null check immediately after obtaining the context.

2. **Missing Error Checking:**
   - **Issue:** The code lacks proper error checking for stream operations (e.g., `Stream_GetRemainingLength`, `Stream_Read(UINT32)`). This can lead to undefined behavior if streams are not properly initialized or data is missing.
   - **Fix:** Implement checks to ensure streams are open and have sufficient data before proceeding.

3. **Bounds Checking:**
   - **Issue:** The decoding functions (e.g., `nsc_decode()`) do not check if `y` or `x` indices are within valid bounds, risking buffer overflows or underflows.
   - **Fix:** Add boundary checks","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

71_riff.c,"1. **Whether the code is vulnerable or not**: The code appears to have robust security measures in place, with thorough error checking and validation to prevent the use of corrupted or malicious files. However, without more details on the implementation of certain functions like `DoGetFilePosition` and `DoReadFile`, it's challenging to definitively assess all potential vulnerabilities.

2. **If YES, please list the vulnerabilities type, the vulnerable lines, and the reason**:
   - **Potential vulnerabilities in file handling functions**: The code uses functions like `DoGetFilePosition` and `DoReadFile` without detailed knowledge of their buffer management. If these functions are not properly bounded, they could allow arbitrary file access or corruption.
   - **File size handling**: The code checks for file size limits but doesn't handle cases where the file is truncated or partially read, potentially leading to silent data corruption.

3. **If NO, please tell me the reason**:
   - The code has good error handling and checks for corrupted files, preventing the use of malicious or corrupted files. It uses qmode settings to validate files and returns errors when necessary, which is a strong security practice.

**Conclusion**: The code is not vulnerable as it stands, but potential vulnerabilities","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Buffer Overflow:** The `cmnd` array is constructed using `strcpy` and `strcat` without checking buffer size, risking overflow.
   - **Unprivileged Mode:** `setuid(UID)` may not terminate properly on failure, allowing unauthorized access.
   - **Remote Code Execution:** Lack of input validation makes the program vulnerable to remote command injection.
   - **Missing Error Checking:** No checks before calling `system(cmnd)`, risking crashes or unintended behavior.
