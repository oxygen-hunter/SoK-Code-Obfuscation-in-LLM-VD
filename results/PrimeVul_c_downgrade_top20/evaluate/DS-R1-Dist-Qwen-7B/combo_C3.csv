35_print-vqp.c,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer Overflow (Stack Overflow)
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: In the `load_program` function, the program_length is incremented without checking if it exceeds the size of the program array.
   - **Reason**: The program array is allocated with a fixed size of 256, but the code does not check if program_length exceeds this size before attempting to write to the array, leading to a buffer overflow and potential undefined behavior.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2017-13045

The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().
",2.0,701.0,6.0,0.9129533767700196
63_common.c,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Reasons:**
   - **Bounds Checking for Program Array:** The code does not check if the address used in instructions like JZ or RET is within the valid range of the program array. This can lead to undefined behavior if the address is out of bounds.
   - **Stack Overflow/Underflow:** The stack is not properly managed, and there are no checks to prevent underflow when popping from an empty stack or overflow when pushing","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"1. **Vulnerability Analysis**: The code does not have any security vulnerabilities.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - **No User Input**: The code does not accept user input that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate memory.
   - **Fixed Code**: The bytecode in `nsc_decode_vm` is hardcoded and does not allow for user-controlled code execution.
   - **Memory and Stack Control**: The memory and stack are controlled within the VM, and their operations are predefined without external dependencies.
   - **No Exploitable Loopholes**: There are no buffer overflows, improper memory access, or untrusted code that could be exploited.

3. **Conclusion**: The code is secure because it does not allow for external code injection or memory manipulation beyond predefined operations.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.
",1.0,785.0,6.0,1.025180101394653
71_riff.c,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. The vulnerabilities include potential stack overflow or underflow due to improper stack management in the VM, and the lack of bounds checking around stack operations.  
3. Reason: The VM's stack is a fixed-size array, and if not properly managed, it could lead to stack overflow or underflow, which are security risks.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

127_chgdbmailusers.c,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Use of `setuid` without proper checks:** The `setuid` function allows the program to run with the privileges of the lowest effective ID, which can lead to unauthorized access if not properly controlled.
   - **Potential use of `system` for command injection:** The `system` function can execute arbitrary commands if not properly validated, leading to code injection vulnerabilities.
3. **Reason:** The code uses system calls (`setuid` and `system`) without proper input validation, which can lead to unauthorized access and command injection, posing significant security risks.","CWE: CWE-74
CVE: CVE-2015-2180

The DBMail driver in the Password plugin in Roundcube before 1.1.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the password.
