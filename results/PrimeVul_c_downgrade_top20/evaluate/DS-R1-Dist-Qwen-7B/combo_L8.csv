CVE: CVE-2017-13045

The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().
",1.0,614.0,6.0,0.9565987586975098
63_common.c,"1. **Vulnerability Identified**: The code has multiple security vulnerabilities, including improper path handling, potential directory traversal, resource leaks, and improper memory management.

2. **Vulnerability Details**:
   - **Path Concatenation**: The use of `strlcat` in `compose_path` without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows if `dir` is too large.
   - **Directory Traversal**: The `chroot` and `chdir` functions can be exploited to change directories, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
   - **Resource Leaks**: The `del_session` function does not properly close all resources, risking memory leaks.
   - **Inadequate Socket Handling**: The `open_socket` function does not check if the port is already in use, which could cause connection issues.
   - **Buffer Overflow**: The `compose_path` function may create a `rpath` buffer that's too small, leading to buffer overflows.
   - **Memory Management**: The `PyCapsule_GetPointer` in `py_compose_path` could cause memory leaks if not properly managed","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"The code provided contains several potential security vulnerabilities, primarily related to memory management, error checking, and improper handling of resources. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Memory Management Issues**:
   - **Global Variables**: The use of global variables for `PyLong` and `Py_DECREF` can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. While the code appears to handle these correctly within the functions, global variables are generally discouraged for such purposes.
   - **Reallocations**: The code uses `realloc` for memory allocations, but there are no checks to ensure that the allocation was successful. If `realloc` fails, it could result in undefined behavior or crashes.

2. **Stream Handling**:
   - **Stream Reads Without Error Checking**: The code uses","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.
",2.0,776.0,6.0,1.0834472179412842
71_riff.c,"1. **Security Vulnerability Type**: Buffer Overflow

2. **Vulnerable Lines**:
   - Lines 16-20: The code uses `DoReadFile` with a buffer size of `sizeof (ChunkHeader)`, which is 20 bytes. If the actual chunk data is larger than 20 bytes, this could cause the buffer to overflow, leading to undefined behavior or data corruption.
   - Lines 43-44: The code uses `DoReadFile` with a buffer size of `sizeof (CS64Chunk)`, which is 40 bytes. Similar to the above, if the chunk data is larger than 40 bytes, this could cause a buffer overflow.
   - Lines 47-48: The code uses `DoReadFile` with a buffer size of `sizeof (DS64Chunk)`, which is 20 bytes. Again, if the chunk data is larger than 20 bytes, this could cause a buffer overflow.

3. **Reason**: The code assumes that the chunk data size is small enough to fit into the buffer size used for reading. If the actual data is larger, the buffer will overflow, leading to data corruption or undefined behavior.

4. **Soft or Hard Error**: This is a potential soft error, as the buffer overflow could go unnoticed until the data is read incorrectly, potentially leading to corrupted files or other issues. It could also be a hard error if the buffer overflow causes a program crash.

5. **Suggested Fix**: Increase the buffer size used in `DoReadFile` calls to ensure it can accommodate the maximum possible chunk data size. This would prevent buffer overflows and ensure data is read correctly.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

127_chgdbmailusers.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Root Privilege Misuse  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Line 10 (UID = 0), Line 12 (cc = libc.setuid(UID)), Line 13 (rc = libc.system(ctypes.byref(cmnd)))  
   - **Reason**: The code uses `setuid(UID)` to grant root privileges, allowing arbitrary command execution. This is a major security risk as it enables unauthorized system commands and potential privilege escalation.  
3. **Other Issues**:  
   - The command string construction may not be secure, but the primary issue is the root privilege grant.","CWE: CWE-74
