2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
3. Vulnerable Lines: 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125
4. Reason: The code does not properly check the length of the input data before processing it, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The `tlen` variable is not properly validated before accessing the data pointed by `tptr`, which can result in reading beyond the allocated memory. This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations and potentially execute arbitrary code.","CWE: CWE-125

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
