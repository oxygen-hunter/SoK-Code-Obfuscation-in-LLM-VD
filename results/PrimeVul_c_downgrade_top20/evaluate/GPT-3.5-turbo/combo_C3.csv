The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().
",1.0,664.0,6.0,2.970111608505249
63_common.c,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Buffer Overflow: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to lack of boundary checks when accessing the stack and program arrays in the VM struct. Specifically, in the `push` and `pop` functions, there are no checks to ensure that the stack pointer (`sp`) does not exceed the maximum stack size (`MAX_STACK_SIZE`). Similarly, in the `run_vm` function, there is no check to ensure that the program counter (`pc`) does not exceed the maximum program size (`MAX_PROGRAM_SIZE`).

3. Vulnerable lines:
   - `push` function: `vm->stack[++vm->sp] = value;`
   - `pop` function: `return vm->stack[vm->sp--];`
   - `run_vm` function: `while (running && vm->pc < MAX_PROGRAM_SIZE) {`

4. Reason:
   - The lack of boundary checks in the code allows for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities where the program can write or read beyond the allocated stack and program arrays, leading to memory corruption and potential security exploits. 

It is recommended to add proper boundary checks in the code to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

2. If NO, please tell me the reason: The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. The code defines structures, enums, functions, and uses a virtual machine to execute instructions related to parsing and writing RIFF headers for audio files.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
