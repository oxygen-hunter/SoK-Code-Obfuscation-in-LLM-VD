2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 97
   Reason: The function `safeputs` is used to print the value of certain objects without checking the length of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the object exceeds the buffer size.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: 97
   Reason: The function `safeputs` is used to print the value of certain objects without proper validation. This can potentially disclose sensitive information if the object contains data that should not be exposed.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 97
   Reason: The code does not perform sufficient input validation on the object values before printing them, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2017-13045

The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().

2. Vulnerability type: Path Traversal
   Vulnerable lines: 42, 43
   Reason: The compose_path function does not properly sanitize the input path, allowing an attacker to perform path traversal attacks by manipulating the path parameter. The code concatenates the input path directly to the base directory without proper validation, which can lead to accessing files outside the intended directory.

3. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability type: Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerable lines: 123-132
   Reason: The new_session function contains code that drops privileges to a specific user and group (if conditions are met) without proper error handling. If the setegid or seteuid functions fail, the code continues execution, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges by bypassing the privilege dropping mechanism.

4. Vulnerable: NO
   Reason: The code does not contain any other apparent security vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"1. Vulnerable: YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Use of insecure functions: The code uses insecure functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `memcpy`, `memset`, etc., which can lead to buffer overflows or other memory-related vulnerabilities. 
     Vulnerable lines: 
     - In the functions `nsc_rle_decode`, `nsc_rle_decompress_data`, `nsc_context_initialize`, `nsc_context_new`, `nsc_context_free`, and `nsc_process_message`.
     Reason: These functions use functions like `FillMemory`, `CopyMemory`, `realloc`, etc., which can lead to buffer overflows if not handled properly.

3. Recommendation:
   - Replace insecure functions with secure alternatives like `strncpy`, `strncat`, `calloc` with size checks, `realloc` with size checks, etc., to prevent buffer overflows and memory-related vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-787

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
