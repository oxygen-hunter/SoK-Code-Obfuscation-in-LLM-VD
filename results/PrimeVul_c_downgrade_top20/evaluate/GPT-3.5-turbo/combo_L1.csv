2. Vulnerability type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable lines: 77, 79, 81
   Reason: The function `OX6D5C4B3A` does not perform proper bounds checking when accessing memory locations using pointers `OX9B8A7C6D` and `OXA9B8C7D`. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input data exceeds the expected size.

3. The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to lack of proper bounds checking when accessing memory locations using pointers.","CWE: CWE-125

   Vulnerability type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable lines: 97
   Reason: The function `system` is not used securely. User input `home` is directly passed to the `system` function, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 47, Line 48, Line 49, Line 50
   Reason: The code is writing data to the memory pointed by the pointer `OX3C9F0A1B` without proper boundary checks, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Type: Memory Leak
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 77
   Reason: Memory allocated for `OX3C9F0A1B->OX7C4B9D2A` is not freed before reallocating it, causing a memory leak.

   Reason: The variable `OX8F9A0B1C` is used without being initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

   - Line 99: `memcpy (&OX1C7F5B3D, OX1D7F3B24, 4);`
   Reason: The code uses `memcpy` to copy data from `OX1D7F3B24` to `OX1C7F5B3D` without checking the size of the source buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow if the source buffer is smaller than the destination buffer.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
