2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 41
   Reason: The code does not check the bounds of the sequence array in the struct vqp_common_header_t when accessing it with EXTRACT_32BITS(&vqp_common_header->sequence). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the sequence array is not 4 bytes long.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 63
   Reason: The code does not validate the vqp_obj_type and vqp_obj_len before processing the object. This can lead to potential buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues if the values are not within expected ranges.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code does not handle the case where vqp_obj_type is 0 or vqp_obj_len is 0. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the values are not valid.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Boundary Checking
   Vulnerable Line: 85
   Reason: The code does not check the bounds of the tptr and tlen variables before accessing the vqp_obj_tlv struct. This can lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption if the values are not properly validated.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2017-13045

The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().

2. Vulnerability type: Path Traversal
   Vulnerable lines: 42, 43
   Reason: The compose_path function does not properly sanitize the input path, allowing an attacker to perform a path traversal attack by manipulating the path variable.

3. Vulnerability type: Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerable lines: 134-142
   Reason: The new_session function does not properly drop privileges before executing potentially dangerous operations, which could lead to privilege escalation attacks.

4. Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 184
   Reason: The del_session function does not securely handle sensitive information, potentially leading to information disclosure vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

CVE: CVE-2018-8788

FreeRDP prior to version 2.0.0-rc4 contains an Out-Of-Bounds Write of up to 4 bytes in function nsc_rle_decode() that results in a memory corruption and possibly even a remote code execution.

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: 93, 94
   Reason: The code does not check the size of the input buffer before copying data into it, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 139
   Reason: The code writes uninitialized memory to the output file in the `WriteRiffHeader` function, which can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.

4. Vulnerability Type: Resource Exhaustion

   Reason: The code does not handle disk full conditions properly when writing data to the output file, which can lead to resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-787
CVE: CVE-2018-10539

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure use of `strcpy` and `strcat` functions can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines: 14, 16
     - Reason: The `strcpy` and `strcat` functions do not perform bounds checking, which can result in writing past the allocated memory for the `cmnd` buffer.
   - Insecure use of `system` function can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable line: 27
     - Reason: The `system` function executes the command passed to it as a string, allowing for command injection if the input is not properly sanitized.
   - Insecure use of `setuid` function without proper error handling.
     - Vulnerable line: 24
     - Reason: The `setuid` function is called without checking the return value for errors, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Use safer functions like `strncpy` and `strncat` instead of `strcpy` and `strcat` to prevent buffer overflows.
   - Sanitize user input before passing it to the `system` function to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
   - Check the return value of `setuid` function for errors and handle them appropriately to prevent privilege escalation vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-74
