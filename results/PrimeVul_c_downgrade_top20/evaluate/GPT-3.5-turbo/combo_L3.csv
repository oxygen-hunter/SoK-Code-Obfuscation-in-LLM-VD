63_common.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 39, 41
   Reason: The compose_path function is vulnerable to command injection due to the use of the system function realpath without proper input validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the path argument to execute arbitrary commands.

3. Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerable Lines: 97-99
   Reason: The code attempts to drop privileges by changing the group and user IDs using setegid and seteuid functions. However, there is no proper error handling in place, and if these calls fail, it could lead to privilege escalation.

4. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 123
   Reason: The code logs the FTP root directory as part of an error message, which could potentially leak sensitive information about the server's file system structure to an attacker.

5. Vulnerability Type: Use of Dangerous Functions
   Vulnerable Lines: 39, 41, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123
   Reason: The code uses potentially unsafe functions like strlcpy, strlcat, memcpy, memset, and memmove without proper bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption vulnerabilities.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 39, 41, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123
   Reason: The code lacks proper input validation for user-controlled input, such as the path argument in the compose_path function, which could lead to various security vulnerabilities like command injection, path traversal, and buffer overflows.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

69_nsc.c,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Unbounded Memory Allocation: The code uses functions like `calloc` and `realloc` to allocate memory for `context->BitmapData` and `context->priv->PlaneBuffers[i]` without checking the return value for NULL. If the memory allocation fails, it can lead to a NULL pointer dereference or other memory corruption issues. 
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       - In function `nsc_context_initialize`:
         - Line 41: `context->BitmapData=calloc(1,length+16);`
         - Line 43: `tmp=realloc(context->BitmapData,length+16);`
         - Line 47: `void*tmp=(BYTE*)realloc(context->priv->PlaneBuffers[i],length);`
     - Reason: Failure to check the return value of memory allocation functions can lead to NULL pointer dereference or memory corruption.

3. Recommendation: Always check the return value of memory allocation functions to handle allocation failures gracefully.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
