The VQP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-vqp.c:vqp_print().

63_common.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability type: Path Traversal
   Vulnerable lines: 42, 43
   Reason: The compose_path function does not properly sanitize the input path, allowing an attacker to perform a path traversal attack by manipulating the path variable. The code concatenates the input path directly to the current directory without proper validation, which can lead to accessing files outside the intended directory.

3. Vulnerability type: Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerable lines: 123-132
   Reason: The new_session function does not properly drop privileges before executing potentially dangerous operations. If the code is running with elevated privileges (e.g., as root), it should drop privileges to a lower-privileged user before performing file operations or network communications to reduce the impact of a potential compromise.

4. Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 161
   Reason: The convert_address function does not validate the length of the buffer before writing the IP address into it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer size is not sufficient to hold the IP address string.

5. Vulnerability type: Use After Free
   Vulnerable lines: 186
   Reason: The del_session function attempts to access memory that has already been freed when checking the ctrl pointer before performing cleanup operations. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability and potentially crash the program or lead to arbitrary code execution.","CWE: CWE-22
CVE: CVE-2020-5221

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
