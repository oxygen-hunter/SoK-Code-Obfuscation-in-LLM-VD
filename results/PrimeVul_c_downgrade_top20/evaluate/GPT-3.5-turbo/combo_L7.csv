2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 97
   Reason: The code at line 97 contains an unsafe inline assembly code block that can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The `asm volatile` block is manipulating the `vqp_obj_len` variable directly without proper bounds checking, which can result in memory corruption and potential security issues.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code at line 77 does not perform proper input validation on the `vqp_obj_type` and `vqp_obj_len` values before using them in the switch-case statements. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities if the input values are manipulated by an attacker.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code at line 77 does not handle the case where `vqp_obj_type` or `vqp_obj_len` is equal to 0. This lack of error handling can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities in the application.","CWE: CWE-125

2. Vulnerability type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable lines: 6, 71
   Reason: The code uses inline assembly with the `__asm__` directive, which can be exploited for code injection attacks. Attackers can potentially inject malicious code into the program by manipulating the assembly instructions within the `__asm__` blocks.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath(). This has been fixed in version 2.11

4. Reason: The `nsc_rle_decode` function uses inline assembly to perform RLE decoding, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Inline assembly is error-prone and can introduce security vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented. It is recommended to use safer alternatives like standard C functions to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-787

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.
