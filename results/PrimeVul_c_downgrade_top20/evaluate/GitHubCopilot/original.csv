   - Out-of-bounds read: in VQP_OBJ_IP_ADDRESS case “ipaddr_string(ndo, tptr), EXTRACT_32BITS(tptr)”. Reason: only ND_TCHECK2(*tptr, vqp_obj_len) is done; if vqp_obj_len < 4, reading 4 bytes overruns captured buffer.
   - Out-of-bounds read: in VQP_OBJ_MAC_ADDRESS and VQP_OBJ_MAC_NULL cases “etheraddr_string(ndo, tptr)”. Reason: requires 6 bytes but code doesn’t ensure vqp_obj_len >= 6, causing potential over-read.
   - Integer underflow/logic error leading to OOB: “tlen-=sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t);” without verifying tlen >= sizeof(struct vqp_obj_tlv_t) before subtract and before header access. Reason: negative tlen or misaccounting can follow, enabling subsequent out-of-bounds accesses.

2. - Stack-based buffer overflow: compose_path(): memmove(dir + len, dir, strlen(dir) + 1); and memcpy(dir, home, len); — no bounds check on PATH_MAX when prefixing home can overflow dir if len + strlen(dir) + 1 > sizeof(dir).
   - Path traversal/sandbox escape (symlink): compose_path(): validation uses if (!chrooted && strncmp(dir, home, strlen(home))) on non-canonical dir, but the canonical path is in rpath; attacker can use symlinks so realpath(rpath) escapes home while dir still appears prefixed.
   - Incomplete privilege drop / potential privilege regain + confused deputy: new_session(): setegid(...); seteuid(...); only change effective IDs, leaving real IDs 0 (can regain root); access(home, W_OK) then checks real UID (root), yielding incorrect authorization decisions.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath().

1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
- Out-of-bounds read/write and integer underflow in RLE decoder
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_rle_decode(): value = *in++; else if (value == *in) { in++; if (*in < 0xFF) { len = (UINT32)*in++; len += 2; } else { in++; len = *((UINT32*)in); in += 4; } FillMemory(out, len, value); out += len; left -= len; } … *((UINT32*)out) = *((UINT32*)in);
  - Reason:
    - No bound on the compressed input; multiple reads from “in” without verifying availability (OOB read).
    - No check that len ≤ left; left -= len can underflow (UINT32), enabling large OOB writes to “out” and potential infinite/long loops (DoS).
    - Unconditional 4-byte tail copy reads/writes 4 bytes even when fewer than 4 remain (OOB read/write).
    - Uses potentially unaligned 32-bit accesses.

- OOB read across plane boundaries during decompression
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_rle_decompress_data(): else if (planeSize < originalSize) nsc_rle_decode(rle, context->priv->PlaneBuffers[i], originalSize); … rle += planeSize;
  - Reason:
    - Decoder receives only originalSize; the compressed source length (planeSize) is not enforced, so the decoder can read past the current plane into subsequent data or beyond the stream buffer.

- Insufficient stream bounds validation for plane data and parameters
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_stream_initialize(): if (Stream_GetRemainingLength(s) < 20) return FALSE; for (i=0;i<4;i++) Stream_Read_UINT32(s, context->PlaneByteCount[i]); … context->Planes = Stream_Pointer(s);
    - Also reads ColorLossLevel/ChromaSubsamplingLevel without validation.
  - Reason:
    - Does not verify that the stream contains at least sum(PlaneByteCount[0..3]) bytes before setting Planes (enables later OOB reads).
    - No range checks on ColorLossLevel/ChromaSubsamplingLevel (feeds into unsafe shifts and indexing).

- Integer overflows leading to undersized allocations and heap overflows
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_context_initialize(): length = context->width * context->height * 4; … calloc/realloc(context->BitmapData, length + 16)
    - In nsc_context_initialize(): tempWidth = ROUND_UP_TO(context->width, 8); tempHeight = ROUND_UP_TO(context->height, 2); length = tempWidth * tempHeight; realloc PlaneBuffers to length
    - In nsc_context_initialize(): context->OrgByteCount[0..3] = products of width/height (and subsampled variants)
  - Reason:
    - width/height are 32-bit; multiplications can overflow UINT32, producing too-small allocations. Subsequent per-pixel writes in nsc_decode() and FillMemory/CopyMemory overflow heap buffers.

- Undefined behavior due to unchecked shift amount (crash/DoS)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_decode(): BYTE shift = context->ColorLossLevel - 1; INT16 co_val = (INT16)(INT8)(*coplane << shift); INT16 cg_val = (INT16)(INT8)(*cgplane << shift);
  - Reason:
    - If ColorLossLevel is 0 (negative shift) or large (shift ≥ bit width), left shift is undefined behavior and can crash.

- Unaligned 32-bit memory access
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_rle_decode(): len = *((UINT32*)in); and *((UINT32*)out) = *((UINT32*)in);
  - Reason:
    - May fault on strict-alignment architectures and exacerbates the OOB issues.

- Stride size overflow (propagates to downstream copies)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_process_message(): if (nDstStride == 0) nDstStride = nWidth * GetBytesPerPixel(DstFormat);
  - Reason:
    - Multiplication can overflow 32-bit, resulting in incorrect stride and potential downstream buffer overruns.

- Memory exhaustion (DoS)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In nsc_context_initialize(): allocations sized directly from untrusted width/height and PlaneByteCount without caps.
  - Reason:
    - Large inputs can force excessive allocations and exhaust memory.

1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
- Integer truncation/overflow and missing NULL check when copying unknown chunks (heap OOB/NULL deref/DoS)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - In ParseRiffHeaderConfig unknown-chunk branch:
      - int bytes_to_copy = (chunk_header.ckSize + 1) & ~1L;
      - char *buff = malloc (bytes_to_copy);
      - if (!DoReadFile (infile, buff, bytes_to_copy, &bcount) || ...
  - Reason:
    - ckSize is uint32_t but bytes_to_copy is int; large values can truncate/wrap negative. malloc result is not checked before use; DoReadFile may write into a NULL pointer or into a too-small allocation if size conversions mismatch, causing crash or heap corruption. Also allows memory-exhaustion with huge allocations.

- Integer overflow in DS64 table-length validation enabling excessive reads (file over-read/DoS)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - if (ds64_chunk.tableLength * sizeof (CS64Chunk) != chunk_header.ckSize - sizeof (DS64Chunk)) { ... }
    - while (ds64_chunk.tableLength--) { CS64Chunk cs64_chunk; if (!DoReadFile (infile, &cs64_chunk, sizeof (CS64Chunk), &bcount) || ... ) { ... } }
  - Reason:
    - tableLength is uint32_t; the multiplication can overflow 32-bit, letting the equality check pass incorrectly. The loop may attempt to read an excessive number of CS64Chunk entries beyond the declared chunk boundary, leading to prolonged I/O or EOF-driven denial of service.

- Truncation of sizes when writing non-RF64 headers (malformed output)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - else { riffhdr.ckSize = (uint32_t) total_riff_bytes; datahdr.ckSize = (uint32_t) total_data_bytes; }
  - Reason:
    - RF64 selection is based on total_data_bytes only. total_riff_bytes can exceed 32 bits in edge cases (e.g., optional chunks), and casting truncates, producing invalid RIFF headers that may confuse downstream parsers.

- 32-bit arithmetic overflow in metadata calculation (incorrect header fields)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - wavhdr.BytesPerSecond = sample_rate * num_channels * bytes_per_sample;
    - wavhdr.BlockAlign = bytes_per_sample * num_channels;
  - Reason:
    - Performed in 32-bit int; large values overflow, yielding incorrect header metadata.

- Potential 64-bit overflow in size math (logic/format errors)
  - Vulnerable lines:
    - total_data_bytes = total_samples * bytes_per_sample * num_channels;
    - total_riff_bytes = sizeof (riffhdr) + wavhdrsize + sizeof (datahdr) + ((total_data_bytes + 1) & ~(int64_t)1) + (do_rf64 ? sizeof (ds64hdr) + sizeof (ds64_chunk) : 0) + table_length * sizeof (CS64Chunk) + (write_junk ? sizeof (junkchunk) : 0);
  - Reason:
    - With extreme/unvalidated inputs, 64-bit intermediate calculations can overflow, generating incorrect sizes and malformed headers.

An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input.

   - Command injection: rc = system(cmnd); combined with building cmnd from argv via strcat — user-controlled arguments interpreted by /bin/sh allow shell metacharacter injection
   - Privilege escalation: cc = setuid(UID); with SUID install (chmod 4550) plus system() — injection yields root RCE; invoking system() in setuid-root context is unsafe
