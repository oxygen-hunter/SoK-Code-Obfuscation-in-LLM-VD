2. - Heap-based buffer overflow – `fgetwln` (`code:31`, `code:45`): The buffer is only enlarged when `wused > fb->len`. When `wused` equals `fb->len`, the check fails, so the next write at `fb->wbuf[wused++]` writes one element past the allocated buffer, enabling heap memory corruption.
","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

2. Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read. Line: `aac_sync`, `hdr_info->channels = ff_mpeg4audio_channels[hdr.chan_config];`. Reason: `hdr.chan_config` originates from the untrusted ADTS header and is used directly as an index into `ff_mpeg4audio_channels` without validating its bounds, so a malformed header can drive an out-of-range access leading to memory disclosure or a crash.
","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. - Type: Out-of-bounds read / denial of service  
     Vulnerable line(s): `rt6_print`: the assignment `len = dp->ip6r_len;` occurs before any `ND_TCHECK` guard (roughly line 34 in the snippet).  
     Reason: The code dereferences attacker-controlled packet data (`dp->ip6r_len`) before verifying that the underlying buffer actually contains those bytes. A truncated capture can make `bp` point at or past `ndo->ndo_snapend`, so this read invokes undefined behavior and can crash the process.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

2. - Out-of-bounds read — `code_snippet.c:23` — `graphics_modes_9[x_dpi / 60]` trusts the caller-controlled DPI. Values ≥300 (or other unsupported values) index past the 5-byte table, pulling arbitrary bytes into `start_graphics` and triggering undefined behaviour.
   - Out-of-bounds read — `code_snippet.c:94` — When DPI maps to the sentinel `-1`, the code still executes `""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics]`, so a negative index is applied to the literal and adjacent memory is read or a crash occurs.

1. YES
      - Out-of-bounds array read at combo_C1/135_gdevepsc.c:126: the code indexes graphics_modes_9/graphics_modes_24 with  
        x_dpi / 60 without validating the DPI value. A crafted printer descriptor that advertises a large DPI causes the   
        index to run past the fixed-size tables, leading to an out-of-bounds read and potential memory disclosure or crash.      - Out-of-bounds read/write at combo_C1/135_gdevepsc.c:215 and combo_C1/135_gdevepsc.c:222: both loop conditions      
        use i <= color_in_size, but the buffer is only color_in_size bytes long. When i == color_in_size, the code still   
        dereferences and writes through realbuf, which points one byte past the allocation, allowing memory corruption or a
