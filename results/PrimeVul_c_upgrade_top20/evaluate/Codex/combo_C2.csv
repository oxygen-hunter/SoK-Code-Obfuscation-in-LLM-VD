2. - Vulnerability Type: Heap-based buffer overflow; Vulnerable Lines: `code.c:37`, `code.c:41`; Reason: The growth guard uses `wused > fb->len`, so when `wused == fb->len` the code writes `fb->wbuf[wused++]`, indexing one past the allocated buffer before the resize logic runs. This off-by-one write corrupts adjacent heap memory and can be exploited to achieve code execution or crash the process.

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

2. - Type: Out-of-bounds read; Vulnerable line: `hdr_info->channels = ff_mpeg4audio_channels[hdr.chan_config];`; Reason: `hdr.chan_config` originates from the parsed bitstream and is used directly as an index into `ff_mpeg4audio_channels` without validating that it is within the array bounds. A crafted ADTS header can set `chan_config` to an out-of-range value, causing an invalid memory read and potential crash or information leak.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. Type: Out-of-bounds read leading to potential DoS; Lines: `rt6_print` in `.../rt6_print.c`: `len = dp->ip6r_len;`, the subsequent `ND_PRINT` calls using `dp->ip6r_len`, `dp->ip6r_type`, `dp->ip6r_segleft`. Reason: These fields are dereferenced before any `ND_TCHECK`/length validation is performed, so a truncated capture buffer lets an attacker trigger an invalid memory read and crash the dissector.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

2. - Out-of-bounds read (`okiibm.c:34`): `start_graphics = graphics_modes_9[x_dpi / 60];` trusts `pdev->x_pixels_per_inch`. Values ≥300 make the index ≥5, reading past the five-element table and propagating the corrupted value into later logic.
   - Out-of-bounds read (`okiibm.c:116`): `gp_fputc((int)(""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics]), prn_stream);` uses the `start_graphics` value without validation. Legitimate table entries include `-1`, so this call can index the string with `-1` (or large unsigned equivalents) and read arbitrary adjacent memory, leading to undefined behavior or data disclosure.

      - Out-of-bounds array read at combo_C2/135_gdevepsc.c:105: the code uses (y_24pin ? graphics_modes_24 :              
        graphics_modes_9)[x_dpi / 60] without validating the divisor result. A crafted pdev->x_pixels_per_inch (e.g., 360  
        or 600) drives the index beyond the fixed-length tables, reading past the array and leaking memory or crashing.    
      - Out-of-bounds read/write at combo_C2/135_gdevepsc.c:203 and combo_C2/135_gdevepsc.c:209: both loops allow i to     
        reach color_in_size, but the buffers are only color_in_size bytes long. When i == color_in_size, realbuf points one
        byte past the allocation and is dereferenced/assigned, allowing attacker-controlled raster data to corrupt memory
