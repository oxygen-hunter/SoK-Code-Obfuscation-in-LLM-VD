- Heap-based buffer overflow – `fgetwln.c:24` (`if (!fb_local->len || u > fb_local->len)`) and `fgetwln.c:33` (`fb_local->wbuf[u++] = wc;`); the capacity check uses `u > len`, so when `u == len` the buffer is already full but not reallocated, and the subsequent write stores past the end of the allocated array.

CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

3. The ADTS header fields are parsed via `avpriv_aac_parse_header`, which rejects malformed values before use; the subsequent assignments simply copy the validated metadata, and the only array access (`ff_mpeg4audio_channels[hdr.chan_config]`) stays within the fixed lookup table because ADTS limits `chan_config` to the defined range.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. - Out-of-bounds read / DoS — `print-rt6.c:49` — `v[0] = dp->ip6r_len;` dereferences the routing header before any `ND_TCHECK`/bounds guard. A truncated IPv6 routing header can leave `dp` pointing past `ndo->ndo_snapend`, so this read touches unmapped memory and crashes the sniffer.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

2. - Vulnerability type: Out-of-bounds array access  
     - Vulnerable line: `okiibm_print_page1` line ~20 (`char start_graphics = graphics_modes_9[vars[5] / 60];`)  
     - Reason: `graphics_modes_9` has only five elements, but `vars[5]` comes from `pdev->x_pixels_per_inch`; values ≥300 make the index ≥5, so the code reads past the lookup table, leading to undefined behavior and attacker-controlled values propagating to later logic.
   - Vulnerability type: Out-of-bounds read / Negative array index  
     - Vulnerable line: `okiibm_output_run` line ~109 (`gp_fputc((int)(""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics]), prn_stream);`)  
     - Reason: `graphics_modes_9` intentionally assigns `-1` for some DPIs. On platforms where `char` is signed (common), `start_graphics` becomes `-1`, so indexing `""KLYZ""` uses `-1`, reading memory before the string; this is deterministic for inputs like 180 DPI and can crash or leak data.

 1. YES
      - Out-of-bounds array read at combo_D4+D5+D6+D7/135_gdevepsc.c:102-117: the code picks graphics_modes_9_b (2 entries)        or graphics_modes_24_b (4 entries) but still indexes them with x_dpi / 60. Common DPIs (e.g., 180 → index 3, 240 → 
        index 4) step past those arrays, so a crafted device descriptor can read past the table, leaking data or crashing. 
      - Out-of-bounds read/write at combo_D4+D5+D6+D7/135_gdevepsc.c:216 and combo_D4+D5+D6+D7/135_gdevepsc.c:224: both    
        loops allow i <= color_in_size, yet color_in is only color_in_size bytes. When i == color_in_size, realbuf is      
        already one byte past the allocation; dereferencing and writing through it corrupts memory, letting malicious      
        raster data crash or hijack the process.
