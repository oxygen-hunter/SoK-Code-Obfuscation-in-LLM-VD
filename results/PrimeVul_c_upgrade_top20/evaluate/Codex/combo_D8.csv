2. - Heap-based buffer overflow — vulnerable at the lines containing `if (!fb->len || wused > fb->len)` and the subsequent `fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;`. When `wused` equals `fb->len`, the condition `wused > fb->len` is false, so the buffer is not grown before writing. The write at index `wused` is then one past the allocated buffer, overflowing the heap buffer.

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

3. The parser only reads validated ADTS header data via `avpriv_aac_parse_header`, which bounds-checks fields and limits `hdr.chan_config` to the valid table range, so the code makes no unchecked memory accesses or other unsafe operations.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

- Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read / crash risk — `rt6.c:16`, `rt6.c:18`, `rt6.c:22`  
  Reason: `dp->ip6r_len`, `dp->ip6r_type`, and `dp->ip6r_segleft` are dereferenced before any length check (e.g., `ND_TCHECK`) confirms that the captured packet actually contains those bytes. With a truncated/short packet an attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or data disclosure.

2. - `Out-of-bounds read`, `okiibm_print_page1`: `char start_graphics = graphics_modes_9[x_dpi / 60];` — `x_pixels_per_inch` is unvalidated, so `x_dpi / 60` can exceed 4. The array `graphics_modes_9` has only 5 elements, so higher DPIs index past the buffer, causing undefined behaviour and potentially leaking adjacent memory.  
   - `Out-of-bounds read`, `okiibm_output_run`: `gp_fputc((int)(""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics]), prn_stream);` — `graphics_modes_9` deliberately stores `-1`, but when reused here it becomes a negative index into the string literal. This underflows the pointer, reading arbitrary memory and emitting attacker-controlled bytes.
