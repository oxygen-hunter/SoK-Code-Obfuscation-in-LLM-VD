2. - Type: Heap buffer overflow; Vulnerable lines: 29-42; Reason: The growth check uses `wused > fb->len`, so when `wused == fb->len` the buffer is not reallocated before writing `fb->wbuf[wused++]`, causing an out-of-bounds write that can be triggered by supplying a line whose length equals the current buffer size.
","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

3. The routine only reads a bounded ADTS header into a fixed-size union, relies on `avpriv_aac_parse_header` to validate header values (including channel configuration), and copies parsed fields into the caller’s context without performing unchecked pointer arithmetic or memory writes; no obvious memory-corruption or trust-boundary violations are present.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. - Out-of-bounds read, `print-rt6.c:17` (`len = dp->ip6r_len;`) and `print-rt6.c:20-22` (the `ND_PRINT` accesses of `dp->ip6r_len`, `dp->ip6r_type`, `dp->ip6r_segleft`). The code reads multiple fields from `dp` before any `ND_TCHECK` validates that those bytes are inside the captured buffer; a truncated packet can therefore drive the parser to read past `ndo->ndo_snapend`, leading to a crash.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

- `CWE-125 Out-of-Bounds Read` – `char start_graphics = graphics_modes_9[x_dpi / 60];` (`okii...print_page1` line 23). The code trusts `pdev->x_pixels_per_inch`; any value ≥300 yields an index ≥5 and reads past `graphics_modes_9[5]`, corrupting control flow for later output.  
- `CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index` – `gp_fputc((int)(""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics]), prn_stream);` (`okii...output_run` line 95). Even with “valid” DPI, `graphics_modes_9[0]` and `[3]` are `-1`; the negative index or any unchecked out-of-range value from the first bug indexes before `""KLYZ""` and reads arbitrary memory, leading to crashes or data disclosure.

1. YES
      - Out-of-bounds array read at combo_L2/135_gdevepsc.c:126: x_dpi / 60 indexes graphics_modes_9 or graphics_modes_24  
        without bounds checks. Standard DPI values (e.g., 180 → index 3, 240 → index 4) already exceed the valid range,    
        so a malicious printer descriptor can force the code to read past the static tables, leaking adjacent memory or    
        crashing.

        color_in_size, but color_in only has color_in_size bytes. When i == color_in_size, the code still dereferences and 
        writes through realbuf, which now points one byte beyond the buffer, enabling crafted raster data to corrupt memory
        or trigger a crash.
