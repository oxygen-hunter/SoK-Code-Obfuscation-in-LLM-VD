2. Heap-based buffer overflow — lines 25 and 39: the resize guard uses `wused > fb->len`, so when `wused == fb->len` the buffer is not grown before `fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;`, causing a write past the allocated bounds and enabling memory corruption.  
   Unbounded recursion / stack exhaustion — line 45: the function recurses once per character with no iterative escape, so an attacker-controlled long line can force deep recursion and crash the process (denial of service).

CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

3. The parser only touches fixed-size, stack-allocated buffers; `avpriv_aac_parse_header()` validates the ADTS fields (including `chan_config`) before they are used, so the array lookup stays in-bounds. All early exits simply signal parse failure without leaving invalid state, so there’s no evident memory safety or control-flow risk.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. - Out-of-bounds read (rt6_print.c:17-23): `rt6_print()` dereferences `dp->ip6r_len`, `dp->ip6r_type`, and `dp->ip6r_segleft` before any `ND_TCHECK`/`ND_TTEST` has confirmed that `bp` actually contains those bytes. If an attacker feeds a truncated IPv6 routing header, these unchecked reads access memory past the captured buffer, leading to a crash/DoS in the sniffer.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

- Out-of-bounds read: `graphics_modes_9[x_dpi / 60]` in `okiibm_print_page1` (around line with `start_graphics = ...`). `x_dpi` is taken from `pdev->x_pixels_per_inch` with no bounds check. Values ≥300 (or any value where `x_dpi/60 ≥ 5`) index the 5-element table past its end, producing undefined behaviour and attacker-controlled reads.  
- Out-of-bounds read: `(""KLYZ""[(int)start_graphics])` in `okiibm_output_run` (around the `gp_fputc` calls). `start_graphics` can be `-1` because `graphics_modes_9` deliberately stores `-1` for several valid DPI slots (e.g., 0, 180 dpi). Passing `-1` to the string index reads before the string buffer, again undefined behaviour that can leak or crash.

These issues stem from unvalidated DPI-derived indices; they allow crafted device settings to trigger memory-safety faults.

      - Out-of-bounds array read at combo_L4+L5+L6/135_gdevepsc.c:125: x_dpi / 60 is used to index graphics_modes_9/       
        graphics_modes_24 without checking the quotient. Typical or malicious DPI values (e.g., 180 → 3, 360 → 6) exceed   
        the 0–4 or 0–6 bounds of the static tables, so an attacker-controlled printer descriptor can drive the code to read        past the arrays and crash or leak adjacent memory.
