2. - Type: Integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflow (`fgetwln` at `53-61`). The `len` field is a `c_size_t`, so the doubling on line `49` can wrap to a small value once the buffer grows past `SIZE_MAX/2`. When that happens, the `realloc` call on line `53` allocates only the wrapped (small) size, but `wused` (lines `60-61`) still indexes using the large logical length that was reached before the wrap, causing writes far past the newly allocated buffer.

CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

2. - Resource exhaustion / memory-leak DoS — `wrap_aac_sync` (calls to `PyDict_SetItemString`) — each `PyLong_FromLong(...)` result keeps an extra reference because `PyDict_SetItemString` adds its own; without a matching `Py_DECREF`, four `PyLong` objects leak per call, so repeated use can exhaust memory and let an attacker trigger denial of service.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. Type: Out-of-bounds read; Lines: `rt6_print` (around 37-45); Reason: `dp->ip6r_len`, `dp->ip6r_type`, and `dp->ip6r_segleft` are read directly from the packet buffer before any `ND_TCHECK`/length validation, so a truncated/forged capture can make `dp` point past `ndo->ndo_snapend`, leading to an invalid memory read.

2. Dynamic Library Hijacking — `ctypes.CDLL('./printer_driver.so')` (line 4): Loading a shared object via a relative path lets an attacker supply a malicious `printer_driver.so` in the working directory (or another location searched first), leading to arbitrary native code execution within the Python process.

2. - Insecure dynamic library loading (`code.py:5`): using `ctypes.CDLL('./epson_printer_driver.so')` relies on the current working directory, so an attacker can plant a malicious library and have it loaded (classic DLL hijacking).
   - Buffer overflow / out-of-bounds write (`code.py:90-92`): the return value of `gdev_prn_copy_scan_lines` is not validated; if it is negative or overly large, `color_in + lcnt * color_line_size` points outside the allocated buffer and `ctypes.memset` writes past the buffer, enabling memory corruption.
   - Denial of service via memory exhaustion (`code.py:62-66`): `in_size`/`out_size` are derived directly from `pdev.width` and DPI without bounds checks; an attacker-controlled device description can force `ctypes.create_string_buffer` to allocate enormous buffers, leading to process failure.
   - Denial of service via unchecked index (`code.py:68`): `x_dpi // 60` is used to index the fixed `graphics_modes_*` tables without ensuring the computed index is in range, so crafted DPI values can trigger an uncaught `IndexError` and crash the routine.
