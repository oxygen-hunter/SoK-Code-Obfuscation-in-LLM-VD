2. Buffer overflow / out-of-bounds write — `fgetwln`:59 and `fgetwln`:72. The growth guard uses `wused > fb->len`, so when `wused == fb->len` the buffer is not reallocated before `fb->wbuf[wused++] = wc;`, causing a write one element past the allocated buffer.
","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
",4.0,695.0,7.0,1.2752008438110352
32_aac_parser.c,"1. NO  
2. The function simply parses an AAC ADTS header into an internal structure, relying on `avpriv_aac_parse_header` to validate the header bits. All array accesses remain within bounds (`ff_mpeg4audio_channels` covers every valid `chan_config` value), and no unchecked buffer writes or trust-incoming-pointer operations occur.
","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. - Vulnerability type: out-of-bounds read / potential crash at `snippet.c:37` and `snippet.c:44` because `dp`/`dp0` fields (`ip6r_len`, `ip6r_type`, `ip6r0_len`) are dereferenced before any length or boundary validation. A truncated or attacker-controlled packet can make `bp` point to insufficient data, so these unchecked reads access memory past `ndo->ndo_snapend`, leading to denial-of-service.

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

1. YES
      - Out-of-bounds read at original/134_gdevokii.c:109: the driver indexes graphics_modes_9 with x_dpi / 60 but never   
        validates that the quotient is within 0–4. A crafted device descriptor (or malicious PostScript) can supply a DPI  
        like 180 or 360, forcing the index past the table and reading unrelated memory.                                    
      - Out-of-bounds read at original/134_gdevokii.c:263: the code then uses the unvalidated start_graphics value as an   
        index into the ""KLYZ"" lookup string. If the previous lookup returns -1 or another invalid value, this reads beyond 
        the bounds of the string and will likely crash.

      - Out-of-bounds array read at original/135_gdevepsc.c:185: the code indexes graphics_modes_9/graphics_modes_24 with  
        x_dpi / 60 but never checks that the quotient fits inside the 5- or 7-element tables. A crafted device descriptor  
        (or hostile resolution setting) can supply a larger DPI value, making the index run past the table, which reads    
        adjacent memory and can crash or leak data.

        still dereference and write through realbuf, which now points one byte beyond the allocation, enabling malicious   
        raster data to corrupt heap memory or terminate the process.
