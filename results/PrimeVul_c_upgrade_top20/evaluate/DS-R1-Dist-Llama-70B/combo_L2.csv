3_fgetwln.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES

2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Buffer Overflow**: The buffer resizing in the loop can lead to memory exhaustion if the input is excessively large, potentially causing a denial of service.
   - **Memory Leak**: On reallocarray failure, the existing buffer isn't freed, leading to memory leaks.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exponential buffer growth can consume excessive memory, causing system resource exhaustion.
   - **Data Corruption**: Lack of thread safety in the buffer pool can cause data races in multi-threaded environments.

3. **Reason**: The function's buffer management lacks proper bounds checking and error handling, leading to potential security issues.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

2. **Vulnerability Type, Vulnerable Lines, and Reason:**
   - **Type:** Buffer Overflow/Incorrect Bitstream Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line where `init_get_bits` is called.
   - **Reason:** The `init_get_bits` function is initialized with `tmp.u8 + 8 - AAC_ADTS_HEADER_SIZE`, which may cause incorrect parsing if the header size is miscalculated, potentially leading to buffer overflow or data corruption.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.
",3.0,727.0,6.0,0.7123613357543945
33_print-rt6.c,"1. **No**, the code is not vulnerable.

2. **Reasoning**: The code includes proper boundary checks using ND_TCHECK and ND_PRINT macros, which are part of a framework designed to safely handle data access and printing, preventing common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. The loop correctly checks against the snapshot end to avoid out-of-bounds access, and the use of goto for error handling, while not ideal for readability, doesn't introduce security risks. The code appropriately truncates and handles unexpected cases without exposing vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-125
