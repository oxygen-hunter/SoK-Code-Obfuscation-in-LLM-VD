CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Type:** Improper Handling of Routing Header Length
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `len` is calculated and used in the loop.
     - **Reason:** The code incorrectly handles cases where the routing header length is odd, leading to potential data truncation and incorrect address parsing.

   - **Type:** Potential Information Leakage or Denial of Service
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The truncation handling and loop termination.
     - **Reason:** Mishandling of header lengths could cause the dissector to crash or display incorrect information when processing crafted packets.

CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.

135_gdevepsc.c,"1. **YES**

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Buffer Overflow and Memory Corruption:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Multiple uses of `gs_malloc` without proper bounds checking. For example, lines where `in` and `out` are allocated.
     - **Reason:** If the allocated memory is overwritten beyond its bounds, it could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

   - **Integer Overflow:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Calculations like `line_size = (pdev->width + 7) >> 3;` and `in_size = line_size * (8 * y_mult);`.
     - **Reason:** If `pdev->width` is large, these calculations could overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation sizes.

   - **Potential Injection Attacks:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Use of `gp_fprintf` and `gp_fputs` with data from `prn_stream`.
     - **Reason:** Unsanitized data could be injected into the printer stream, potentially leading to command injection.

   - **Use of Inline Assembly:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The `__asm__ __volatile__` block.
     - **Reason:** Inline assembly can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly handled, especially regarding register management and side effects.
