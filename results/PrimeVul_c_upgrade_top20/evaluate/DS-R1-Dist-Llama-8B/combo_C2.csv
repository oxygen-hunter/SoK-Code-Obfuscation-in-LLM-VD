3_fgetwln.c,"The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities. It properly handles buffer expansion and uses safer functions like reallocarray. The only potential issue is the use of static variables in multi-threaded environments, but without knowing the context, this isn't a security flaw.

1. NO
2. No vulnerabilities identified.
3. The code uses safe buffer handling and static variables, but potential issues may arise in multi-threaded environments.
4. No specific security vulnerabilities are present.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

32_aac_parser.c,"The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities. It properly initializes the parser context and handles the parsing states without exposing memory or allowing invalid input to cause security issues.

1. **Vulnerable?** NO
2. **Reason:** The code correctly initializes the parser context and handles the parsing states without any obvious security vulnerabilities. It does not expose memory or allow invalid input to cause security issues.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

33_print-rt6.c,"The code does not contain any security vulnerabilities. It correctly processes the IPv6 routing header and handles various states properly without any obvious issues like buffer overflows or infinite loops.

1. **Vulnerable?** NO
2. **Reason:** The code correctly processes the IPv6 routing header, handles different states, and includes proper input validation using `ND_TCHECK`. There are no buffer overflow risks or infinite loops that could lead to security issues.","CWE: CWE-125

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().

134_gdevokii.c,"The code contains two security vulnerabilities:

1. **Buffer Overrun in Index Array**: In the `okiibm_print_page1` function, the loop iterates from 0 to 15, but the `graphics_modes_9` array only has 5 elements. Accessing `index[15]` causes an out-of-bounds error.

CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.
",3.0,696.0,6.0,1.7755672931671145
135_gdevepsc.c,"The code contains several memory management issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.

1. **Memory Leaks and Null Pointer Dereferences:**
   - **Lines 123-124 and 126:** The code calls `gs_free` on `in` and `out` without checking if they are null. If `in` or `out` are null, this will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or memory corruption.
   - **Lines 135-137:** After allocating `color_in`, the code attempts to free it without checking if the allocation was successful. If `color_in` is null, this will cause a crash.
   - **Lines 148-149:** The code uses `memset` on potentially null pointers if `color_in` is not properly initialized.

2. **Potential Buffer Overflow:**
   - **Lines 123-124:** If `in` or `out` are not properly checked before being passed to `gs_free`, this could lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption.

**Recommendation:** Replace `gs_free` calls with proper memory management that checks for null pointers and ensures all allocated memory is properly managed to prevent leaks and crashes.","CWE: CWE-120
