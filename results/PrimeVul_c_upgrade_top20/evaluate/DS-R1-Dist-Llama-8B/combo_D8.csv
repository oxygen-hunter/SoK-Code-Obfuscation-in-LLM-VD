3_fgetwln.c,"The code is vulnerable because it can return a null pointer when realloc fails, which may not be properly handled by the caller, potentially leading to a crash or denial of service.

1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Null Pointer Return  
   - **Lines**: Lines 15-16  
   - **Reason**: The function may return a null pointer if reallocarray fails, which can cause issues for the caller if they don't check for null. This can lead to a crash or denial of service.","CWE: CWE-119
