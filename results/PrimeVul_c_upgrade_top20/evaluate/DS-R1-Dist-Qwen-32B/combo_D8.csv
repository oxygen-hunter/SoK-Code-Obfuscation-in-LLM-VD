3_fgetwln.c,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Thread Safety Issue (Race Condition)**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The entire function uses static variables (`fb_pool` and `fb_pool_cur`) without any locking mechanism.
   - **Reason**: In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads can interfere with each other's data, leading to data corruption or undefined behavior.

2. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `reallocarray` is called.
   - **Reason**: If `reallocarray` fails, the old buffer is lost, causing a memory leak. The function doesn't free the old buffer before attempting to reallocate.

3. **Potential Null Pointer Dereference**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Return statement at the end.
   - **Reason**:","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
",2.0,782.0,6.0,0.8682050704956055
32_aac_parser.c,"The code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. The buffer handling in the `aac_sync` function correctly initializes the `GetBitContext` with the appropriate size, preventing buffer overflow. The use of helper functions like `getZero()` and `getOne()` doesn't introduce security risks. Without evidence of improper handling in external functions, the code appears secure.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable?** NO  
2. **Reason:** The code correctly initializes the buffer size for parsing, preventing overflow. No evident security issues are present.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

33_print-rt6.c,"The code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Vulnerability Check**: NO
2. **Reason**: The code processes IPv6 routing headers and includes checks to prevent buffer overflows. While the use of helper functions for variable access is unconventional, it doesn't introduce clear security flaws. The bounds checking and truncation mechanisms help prevent overflows. The code structure is complex but doesn't expose obvious attack vectors.","CWE: CWE-125

134_gdevokii.c,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Buffer Overflow (Index Out of Bounds):**
     - **Lines:** In `okiibm_print_page1`, the array `graphics_modes_9` is indexed by `x_dpi / 60`. If `x_dpi` is large enough, this can exceed the array's bounds (indices 0-4).
     - **Reason:** Accessing an array beyond its size can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or code execution.

   - **Buffer Overflow (memcpy Without Bounds Check):**
     - **Lines:** In `okiibm_print_page`, `memcpy` is used to append data to `init_string` and `end_string` without checking if there's enough space.
     - **Reason:** This can cause buffer overflow if the destination arrays are not large enough, leading to data corruption or code injection.

3. **Summary:**
   The code contains buffer overflow vulnerabilities","CWE: CWE-120
