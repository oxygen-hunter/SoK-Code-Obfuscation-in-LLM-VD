3_fgetwln.c,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. The vulnerabilities include:
   - Use of non-portable GNU extension reallocarray.
   - Static buffers leading to potential memory leaks.
   - Possible buffer overflow due to incorrect buffer management.
   - No checks for EOF during buffer reallocation.
   - Potential race condition with static variables in a multi-threaded environment.
   - No synchronization, leading to possible data corruption.
   - No proper handling of invalid file pointers, which could cause undefined behavior.  
3. The reason is that the code lacks proper error handling, buffer management, and thread safety, making it vulnerable to various security issues.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
",2.0,735.0,6.0,0.7778527736663818
32_aac_parser.c,"1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: The code does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities.

2. **Reasoning**: 
   - The code includes necessary headers but does not contain any obvious buffer overflow, improper memory access, or use of untrusted data.
   - The `aac_sync` function uses unions correctly to handle bit manipulation, and the initialization function `aac_parse_init` seems secure.
   - The AAC parser structure follows best practices, avoiding direct memory manipulation and using standard functions for cleanup.
   - Without specific vulnerabilities found, the code is considered secure.

3. **Conclusion**: The code is secure and does not have any identified vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

33_print-rt6.c,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Use of a potentially dangerous header  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The code includes `extract.h`, which is used for extracting arbitrary code from binaries.  
   - **Reason**: The inclusion of `extract.h` can be exploited to inject malicious code or gain unauthorized access, posing a significant security risk.","CWE: CWE-125

CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.

135_gdevepsc.c,"1. **Vulnerability Type**: Potential buffer overflow and improper handling of color values.
2. **Vulnerable Lines**:
   - Line 19: `cv_shift = sizeof(gx_color_value) * 8 - 1;` - This could cause undefined behavior if `gx_color_value` is not a 32-bit value.
   - Line 25: `#define c1 gx_max_color_value` - If `gx_max_color_value` is larger than 255, using it in a bitwise OR with `0x80` could cause incorrect color values.
3. **Reason**: The code uses bitwise operations without ensuring that the values are within safe bounds, which could lead to buffer overflows or incorrect color handling.

The code appears to handle color mapping and graphics printing but lacks proper bounds checking and memory management, which could introduce vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-120
