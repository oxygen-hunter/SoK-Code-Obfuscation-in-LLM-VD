2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 42
   Reason: The code uses reallocarray to reallocate memory for the wbuf buffer without checking if the reallocation is successful. If reallocarray fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, but the code continues to use the old buffer, leading to potential memory corruption vulnerabilities.

3. YES
4. The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the improper handling of reallocarray's return value.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

135_gdevepsc.c,"1. Vulnerable: YES
2. Vulnerability type: Buffer Overflow
3. Vulnerable lines: Line 158, Line 159
4. Reason: The code does not properly handle buffer sizes in the `epsc_print_page` function. The `in` and `out` buffers are allocated with sizes that are calculated based on the device properties, but the code does not ensure that the calculated sizes are sufficient to hold the data being processed. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

5. Vulnerable: YES
6. Vulnerability type: Uncontrolled Recursion
7. Vulnerable lines: Line 158, Line 159
8. Reason: The `epsc_print_page` function contains a recursive call to itself within a loop without proper termination conditions. This can lead to uncontrolled recursion and potential stack overflow vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-120
