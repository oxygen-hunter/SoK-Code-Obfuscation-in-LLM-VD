2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 97, 98
   Reason: The code uses the `reallocarray` function to reallocate memory for the `wbuf` buffer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If the reallocation fails, the `wbuf` pointer will be set to NULL, leading to a potential use-after-free vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
   Vulnerable Lines: 97, 98
   Reason: The code does not have proper checks for the maximum buffer size (`fb->len`) before doubling it in the reallocation process. This can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the buffer size grows too large.

4. Vulnerability Type: Untrusted Input
   Vulnerable Lines: 97, 98
   Reason: The code reads input from a file using `fgetwc`, which can potentially lead to untrusted input being processed without proper validation, potentially resulting in security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Type: Buffer Overflow
   - Vulnerable lines: 
     ```c
     vm->program[vm->program_size++] = av_be2ne64(state);
     ```
   - Reason: The code does not perform bounds checking when writing to the `program` array, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the `program_size` exceeds the allocated size of the array.

3. Recommendation: Implement proper bounds checking when writing to the `program` array to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: `vm->memory[vm->program_counter++]`
   Reason: The code does not perform bounds checking when accessing the `vm->memory` array using the `vm->program_counter` as an index. This can lead to buffer overflow if the `vm->program_counter` exceeds the bounds of the `vm->memory` array.

3. Vulnerability Type: Untrusted Input
   Vulnerable Lines: `okiibm_print_page((gx_device_printer*)vm->registers[0], (gp_file*)vm->registers[1]);` and `okiibm_output_run((byte*)vm->registers[0], vm->registers[1], vm->registers[2], (char)vm->registers[3], (gp_file*)vm->registers[4], vm->registers[5]);`
   Reason: The code passes untrusted input directly to the functions `okiibm_print_page` and `okiibm_output_run` without proper validation. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: `unsigned char program[PROGRAM_SIZE];`
   Reason: The `program` array is of fixed size `PROGRAM_SIZE`, but the `setup_program` function initializes it with a program that may exceed the size of the array, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: `vm->pc = vm->program[vm->pc];`
   Reason: The code does not validate the value of `vm->pc` before using it as an index to access the `program` array, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Bounds Checking
   Vulnerable Line: `vm_push(vm, vm->program[vm->pc++]);`
   Reason: The code does not check if the stack pointer `sp` exceeds the `STACK_SIZE` before pushing a value onto the stack, potentially causing a stack overflow.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: `vm->pc = vm->program[vm->pc++];`
   Reason: The code does not handle errors that may occur during program execution, such as division by zero or invalid operations, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Stack Protection
   Vulnerable Line: `vm->stack[vm->program[vm->pc++]] = vm_pop(vm);`
   Reason: The code allows direct access to the stack memory without proper validation, which can lead to stack corruption or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Code Integrity Checks
   Vulnerable Line: `vm->pc = target;`
   Reason: The code does not verify the integrity of the program instructions before jumping to a target address, making it vulnerable to code injection attacks.

8. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure Coding Practices
   Vulnerable Line: `vm->stack[++vm->sp] = value;`
   Reason: The code does not use secure coding practices like bounds checking or input validation when manipulating the stack, which can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-120
