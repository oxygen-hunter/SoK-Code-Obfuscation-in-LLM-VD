2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 33, 35
   Reason: The code uses the `reallocarray` function to reallocate memory for the `wbuf` buffer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If the reallocation fails, the original buffer is not freed, leading to a memory leak and potential memory corruption.

3. The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the lack of proper error handling after reallocating memory.","CWE: CWE-119
