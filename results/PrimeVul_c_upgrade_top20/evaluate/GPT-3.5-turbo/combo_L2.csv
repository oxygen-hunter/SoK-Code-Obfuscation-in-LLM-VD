2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 33, 35
   Reason: The code uses the `reallocarray` function to reallocate memory for the `wbuf` buffer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If the `reallocarray` function fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, but the code does not handle this case properly. This can lead to memory corruption issues when trying to access the NULL pointer.

3. The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to improper handling of memory reallocation failures.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 33
   Reason: The code does not check if the length of the input data is within the bounds of the buffer before accessing it. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Leak
3. Vulnerable Lines: Line 41, Line 42
4. Reason: The code allocates memory for `buf1` and `buf2` using `gs_malloc`, but does not free the allocated memory before returning from the function. This leads to a memory leak as the allocated memory is not released properly.

1. Vulnerable: YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
3. Vulnerable Lines: Line 108
4. Reason: The code writes data to the `init_string` and `end_string` arrays without checking the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow if the source data exceeds the size of the destination buffer.

1. Vulnerable: NO
2. Reason: The code does not contain any direct vulnerabilities related to input validation or insecure functions.","CWE: CWE-120
CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.

135_gdevepsc.c,"1. Vulnerable: YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Memory Allocation: The code uses `gs_malloc` and `gs_free` for memory allocation and deallocation. These functions are prone to memory corruption vulnerabilities if not used properly. Specifically, the code allocates memory for `in`, `out`, and `color_in` arrays without proper size checks, which can lead to buffer overflows.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       - `byte *in = (byte *) gs_malloc(pdev->memory, in_size + 1, 1, ""epsc_print_page(in)"");`
       - `byte *out = (byte *) gs_malloc(pdev->memory, out_size + 1, 1, ""epsc_print_page(out)"");`
       - `if ((color_in = (byte *) gs_malloc(pdev->memory, color_in_size + 1, 1, ""epsc_print_page(color)"")) == 0) {`
     - Reason: The code does not perform proper size validation for memory allocations, which can lead to buffer overflows if the allocated size is insufficient for the data being written.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper size checks for memory allocations to prevent buffer overflows.
   - Use safer memory allocation functions or ensure proper bounds checking when using `gs_malloc` and `gs_free`.","CWE: CWE-120
