3_fgetwln.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 41
   Reason: The code uses the `reallocarray` function to reallocate memory for the `wbuf` buffer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If the reallocation fails, the original buffer is not freed, leading to a memory leak and potential memory corruption.

3. Vulnerability Type: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
   Vulnerable Lines: 41
   Reason: The code does not have a limit on the number of times the `reallocarray` function can be called to increase the size of the `wbuf` buffer. This can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption and potential denial of service if the buffer size grows excessively.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 41
   Reason: The code does not validate the input size before writing to the `wbuf` buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input size exceeds the allocated buffer size.","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
",2.0,815.0,6.0,0.6207187175750732
32_aac_parser.c,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure include directive: The code includes header files using double quotes which may lead to including files from unintended directories. This can potentially lead to including malicious files or files with unintended functionality.
     Vulnerable line: 
     ```c
     #include""parser.h"" #include""aac_ac3_parser.h"" #include""aacadtsdec.h"" #include""get_bits.h"" #include""mpeg4audio.h""
     ```
     Reason: Using double quotes for including header files can allow an attacker to manipulate the include path and potentially include malicious files.

3. Recommendation: Use angle brackets (`<>`) instead of double quotes for system header files to prevent unintended file inclusions. Ensure that the include paths are properly configured to avoid including files from unintended directories.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.
",2.0,784.0,6.0,0.817859411239624
33_print-rt6.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: `if((const u_char *)(addr+1)>ep)goto trunc;`
   Reason: The code does not properly check the bounds of the memory buffer before accessing it, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the address exceeds the memory bounds.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: `ND_PRINT((ndo,"", rsv=0x%0x"",EXTRACT_32BITS(&dp0->ip6r0_reserved)));`
   Reason: The code does not validate the input data before printing it, which can lead to information disclosure or unexpected behavior.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: `if(len%2==1)goto trunc;`
   Reason: The code does not handle the case where the length is odd, which can lead to truncation of data or unexpected behavior.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2017-13725

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().
",2.0,797.0,6.0,0.8261897563934326
134_gdevokii.c,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 3
   Reason: The code includes a header file ""gdevprn.h"" without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to code injection attacks if the header file is controlled by an attacker.

3. Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Credentials
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 77, 79
   Reason: The code contains hardcoded initialization and end strings (okiibm_init_string and okiibm_end_string) that could potentially expose sensitive information or credentials.

4. Not Sure
   Reason: The code may have other vulnerabilities related to memory management, input validation, and potential buffer overflows that require further analysis and testing.","CWE: CWE-120
