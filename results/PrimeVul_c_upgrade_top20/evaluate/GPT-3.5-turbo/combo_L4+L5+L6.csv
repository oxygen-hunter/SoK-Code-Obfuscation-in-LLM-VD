2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 29, 31
   Reason: The code uses a recursive function `process_file` to read characters from a file stream and store them in a buffer. The buffer resizing logic in the `process_file` function can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the code doubles the buffer size when it's full, but it does not check for integer overflow when calculating the new buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the calculated size exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `size_t` data type.
