      - Vulnerable Lines: Inside the while loop where the reallocation condition is checked","CWE: CWE-119
CVE: CVE-2016-2090

Off-by-one vulnerability in the fgetwln function in libbsd before 0.8.2 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
",3.0,646.0,6.0,0.7147774696350098
32_aac_parser.c,"1. Vulnerable: NO

2. Reason:
   • The provided code carefully processes a fixed-size header. It converts the 64‐bit state into a byte array and then uses an offset calculated from a defined header size (AAC_ADTS_HEADER_SIZE), ensuring that the pointer arithmetic remains within bounds.
   • The header parsing function (avpriv_aac_parse_header) is called with a properly initialized GetBitContext, and its return value is checked.
   • No unchecked buffer accesses, integer overflows, or unsafe memory operations appear in this snippet.
   • Overall, the code adheres to appropriate C practices in this context, and there is no evidence of a direct security vulnerability in the provided fragment.","CWE: CWE-125
CVE: CVE-2016-7393

Stack-based buffer overflow in the aac_sync function in aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted file.

CVE: CVE-2017-13725

The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().
",1.0,640.0,6.0,0.6307687759399414
134_gdevokii.c,"1. Vulnerable? NO

2. Explanation:
   • The code strictly operates on controlled data and internal buffers (allocated via gs_malloc with proper error‐handling) and uses fixed‐size arrays for initialization and termination strings, so there isn’t any obvious buffer overrun or heap corruption.
   • Memory allocations are checked for success before use, and any failures promptly free allocated memory and return an error.
   • The use of memcpy, memcmp, and related functions is done with constant sizes or sizes computed from internal parameters (for example, the line size is derived from gdev_mem_bytes_per_scan_line), reducing the risk of overflows.
   • All printer commands are written via gp_fwrite/gp_fprintf/gp_fputc and use carefully computed parameters. There is no indication that untrusted external input is used for command or memory operations.
   • While this is low‐level printer driver","CWE: CWE-120
CVE: CVE-2020-16301

A buffer overflow vulnerability in okiibm_print_page1() in devices/gdevokii.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF file. This is fixed in v9.51.
",1.0,808.0,6.0,0.6566603183746338
135_gdevepsc.c,"1. Vulnerable? NO.

2. Explanation:
 • The code performs most memory allocations with extra bytes (e.g. “in_size + 1”, “out_size + 1”) and checks for allocation failures before proceeding.
 • The pointer arithmetic and buffer‐manipulation routines (for example, in the loops that process scan lines and transpose blocks) include bounds considerations that—in the context of controlled printer‐device parameters—prevent overruns.
 • The format strings used in the gp_fprintf/gp_fputs calls are constant strings combined with numeric values computed internally, so they do not open a format string vulnerability.
 • Although some arithmetic (for example computing “line_size” from pdev->width) might be delicate if pdev’s parameters were set to extreme, untrusted values, in typical use these parameters come from configuration or trusted internal state. In other words, potential integer overflow issues exist only if the device parameters were maliciously altered.
 
3. Reason:
 The code is written as part of a printer driver in a controlled environment. Memory allocations are checked and extra space is allocated to avoid overruns. Input for key parameters (such as the page width or color buffers) is expected to be coming from trusted sources (or is validated by the surrounding Ghostscript framework), so under normal conditions no exploitable vulnerability is present.

4. Note:
 If, however, the printer device parameters were influenced by untrusted input without additional validation, then there could be a risk of arithmetic (or allocation) errors. In the current context, however, that possibility is very remote, which is why the overall conclusion is “NO” for vulnerabilities.","CWE: CWE-120
