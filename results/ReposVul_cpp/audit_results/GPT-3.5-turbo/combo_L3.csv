3. YES
   Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to information disclosure as it logs the file name in the error message when the file is not a valid PLS playlist. This could potentially leak sensitive information about the file system structure to an attacker.

4. NOT SURE
   Reason: The code is quite lengthy and complex, making it difficult to thoroughly analyze all potential vulnerabilities without a deeper understanding of the entire system and its dependencies. Further analysis may be required to identify additional vulnerabilities.",2263,184,1.7433862686157229

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: 38
   Reason: The code uses the unsafe function `fgets` to read input into the buffer `buff` without specifying the size of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the size of the buffer (256 bytes).

3. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability Type: Resource Leak
   Vulnerable Lines: 39, 41
   Reason: The code opens a file using `fopen` but does not close the file using `fclose` in all code paths. This can lead to resource leaks and potential denial of service if the file descriptors are not properly closed.

   - `std::string clean_var = var;`
   - `sanitize_string(clean_name);`
   - `sanitize_string(clean_var);`
   Reason: The `sanitize_string` function does not properly sanitize the input strings `name` and `var`, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input strings contain special characters that are not properly sanitized.

3. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `std::string in = deSerializeJsonStringIfNeeded(is);`
   - `m_stringvars[name] = var;`
   Reason: The `deSerializeJsonStringIfNeeded` function does not properly validate and sanitize the input string `in`, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input string contains malicious code.

4. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `std::istringstream is(getString(TOOLCAP_KEY));`
   Reason: The code retrieves and deserializes tool capabilities from a string stored in `TOOLCAP_KEY` without proper validation, which can lead to potential information disclosure if the string contains sensitive data or malicious content.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `if (in[0] == DESERIALIZE_START) {`
   Reason: The code lacks proper input validation when checking the first character of the deserialized string, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the input string does not conform to expected formats.

6. Vulnerability Type: Insecure Deserialization
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `toolcaps_override.deserializeJson(is);`
   Reason: The code performs deserialization of tool capabilities from an input stream without proper validation or secure deserialization mechanisms, which can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

7. Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Secret
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `#define TOOLCAP_KEY ""tool_capabilities""`
   Reason: The tool capabilities key is hardcoded in the code, which can expose sensitive information and make it easier for attackers to identify and target specific functionalities in the application.",727,457,3.362988471984864

3. Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 99
   Reason: The code reveals sensitive information by writing error messages to the console, which can potentially leak information about the system or application to attackers.

4. Vulnerability type: Authorization Bypass
   Vulnerable lines: 123

81_calenderServer.cpp,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Unhandled exceptions: The code does not handle exceptions properly. For example, in the `main` function, the `stoi` function can throw `invalid_argument` and `out_of_range` exceptions, but these exceptions are caught using an incorrect syntax. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
     - Vulnerable lines: 10, 11, 12
     - Reason: The catch block should catch exceptions by reference (`catch(const invalid_argument& e)` and `catch(const out_of_range& e)`).

   - Buffer overflow: The code uses a fixed-size buffer `requestBuffer` of size 513 without proper bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable line: 89
     - Reason: The `recv` function can read more than `BUFFERSIZE` bytes into `requestBuffer`, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

   - Command injection: The code constructs a command string using user input without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines: 126, 134, 142, 150, 158, 166, 174, 182
     - Reason: User input from the request is directly used in constructing strings without proper validation, allowing for potential command injection attacks.
