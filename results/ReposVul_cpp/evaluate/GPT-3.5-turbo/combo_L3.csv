   - `std::string clean_name = name;`
   - `std::string clean_var = var;`
   - `sanitize_string(clean_name);`
   - `sanitize_string(clean_var);`
   Reason: The `sanitize_string` function does not properly sanitize the input strings `name` and `var`, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input strings contain special characters that are not properly sanitized.

3. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `std::string in = deSerializeJsonStringIfNeeded(is);`
   - `m_stringvars[name] = var;`
   Reason: The `deSerializeJsonStringIfNeeded` function does not properly validate and sanitize the input string `in`, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input string contains malicious code.

4. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `std::istringstream is(getString(TOOLCAP_KEY));`
   Reason: The code retrieves and deserializes tool capabilities from a string stored in `TOOLCAP_KEY` without proper validation, which can lead to potential information disclosure if the string contains sensitive data or malicious content.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `if (in[0] == DESERIALIZE_START) {`
   Reason: The code lacks proper input validation when checking the first character of the deserialized string, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the input string does not conform to expected formats.

6. Vulnerability Type: Insecure Deserialization
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `toolcaps_override.deserializeJson(is);`
   Reason: The code performs deserialization of tool capabilities from an input stream without proper validation or secure deserialization mechanisms, which can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

7. Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Secret
   Vulnerable Lines: 
   - `#define TOOLCAP_KEY ""tool_capabilities""`
   Reason: The tool capabilities key is hardcoded in the code, which can expose sensitive information and make it easier for attackers to identify and target specific functionalities in the application.","CVE: CVE-2022-24300

2. Vulnerability type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable lines: 77, 78
   Reason: The code constructs a command to be executed by concatenating user-controlled input (benchmarkFile) without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker manipulates the input to execute arbitrary commands.

3. Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 99
   Reason: The code reveals sensitive information by writing error messages to the console, which can potentially leak information about the system or application to attackers.

81_calenderServer.cpp,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Unhandled exceptions: The code does not handle exceptions properly. For example, in the `main` function, the `stoi` function can throw `invalid_argument` and `out_of_range` exceptions, but these exceptions are caught using an incorrect syntax. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
     - Vulnerable lines: 10, 11, 12
     - Reason: The catch block should catch exceptions by reference (`catch(const invalid_argument& e)` and `catch(const out_of_range& e)`).

   - Buffer overflow: The code uses a fixed-size buffer `requestBuffer` of size 513 without proper bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable line: 89
     - Reason: The `recv` function can read more than `BUFFERSIZE` bytes into `requestBuffer`, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

   - Command injection: The code constructs a command string using user input without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines: 126, 134, 142, 150, 158, 166, 174, 182
     - Reason: User input from the request is directly used in constructing strings without proper validation, allowing for potential command injection attacks.
