16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **Buffer Overflow in OX7B4DF339::OX9A2C8E4D Method**  
     - **Lines:** 13-20  
     - **Reason:** The method writes multiple 32-bit unsigned integers without proper bounds checking, risking buffer overflow if the data exceeds expected sizes.  
   - **Potential Information Leak in OX7B4DF339::OX6A8B4E2C Method**  
     - **Lines:** 28-32  
     - **Reason:** The fixed-size array `OX9F8E7D6C` could lead to information leaks if the data exceeds the array size.  

3. **Reason:** The code has potential buffer overflow risks in the `OX9A2C8E4D` method due to improper handling of 32-bit writes and may leak information in the `OX6A8B4E2C` method.","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

2. **Vulnerability Type:** Timing Attack (Linear Interpolation)  
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines 13-18 and 20-28 in the `OX2E5B7C9F` function.  
   - **Reason:** The function uses linear interpolation when `OX9C8E4F0A` is `false`, allowing an attacker to perform a timing attack by measuring the time taken to compute each value, which can reveal the table's contents.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017
