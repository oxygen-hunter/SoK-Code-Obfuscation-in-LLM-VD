16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Buffer Overflows:** The code may suffer from buffer overflows in the `Create`, `AP4_HdlrAtom`, and `WriteFields` methods if the input data doesn't fit the expected sizes, leading to undefined behavior or crashes.
   - **Stream Positioning:** The code doesn't ensure that the stream is correctly positioned after reading fields, which can cause issues in subsequent operations.
   - **Incorrect Padding:** The padding calculation in `WriteFields` might not account for the actual name length, leading to data corruption or truncation.
   - **Null Terminator Handling:** The code assumes a null terminator, but improper handling could lead to incorrect data being passed to the inspector.
3. **Reason:** The code lacks proper validation and error handling for input data sizes, leading to potential buffer overflows and data corruption.","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. The code has multiple vulnerabilities:
   - **Infinite Loop**: The switch statement in the decode method lacks a default case, leading to an infinite loop if none of the cases match.
   - **Buffer Underflow**: The code may cause undefined behavior when the buffer is empty, especially in cases where trimming or moving is attempted.
   - **Format String Vulnerability**: The fail function constructs an error message using a potentially untrusted parameter (len), which could be a format string vulnerability.
   - **maxLength_ Zero**: If maxLength_ is zero, findEndOfLine may","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
   - **.getTable() function**: Does not check for negative `n`, leading to undefined behavior.  
   - **setTable() function**: Does not validate the contents of the provided table, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid data is used.  
   - **setTable() function**: Does not check if `ntable` is within the valid range of `ntables`, though this is handled in the constructor.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017

80_helper.cpp,"1. **Vulnerability Identified**: The code has multiple security vulnerabilities.

2. **Vulnerability Details**:
   - **Insufficient Input Validation**: The code lacks proper input validation for file paths and command-line arguments, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
   - **Raw File Operations**: Direct manipulation of system files like `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` without proper checks can lead to unauthorized file modifications.
   - **Circular Dependency**: The `HelperAdaptor` and `Helper` class have a circular dependency that could cause resource leaks or infinite loops.
   - **Lack of Authorization Details**: The `isCallerAuthorized` method doesn't provide detailed authorization failure messages, making debugging difficult.
   - **Unrestricted Service Initialization**: The `Helper` class initializes without verifying the helper service's state or user authorization.

3. **Reason**: The code lacks proper security measures against injection, file manipulation, and unauthorized service access, making it vulnerable to exploitation.

4. **Suggested Reason**: The absence of security guards against common attacks increases the risk of unauthorized access, file tampering, and service misconfigurations.","CVE: CVE-2022-40673
