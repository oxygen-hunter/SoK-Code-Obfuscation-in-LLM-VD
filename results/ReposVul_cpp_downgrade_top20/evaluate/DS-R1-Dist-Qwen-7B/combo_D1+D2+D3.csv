16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Potential Integer Overflow and Buffer Overflows
   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - `AP4_HdlrAtom::WriteFields`: Lines where padding is calculated and written.
   - **Reason:** The padding calculation uses `m_Size32`, a 32-bit unsigned integer, which can cause underflow if `m_Size32` is smaller than the sum, leading to negative padding and potential buffer overflows.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Potential Data Loss or Truncation
   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - `AP4_HdlrAtom::Create`: Lines where the handler name is read and checked.
   - **Reason:** If the first byte of the handler name doesn't match its length, the name is truncated, leading to data loss and potential corruption of","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Potential Buffer Overflow
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines involving buffer operations in the decode function.
   - **Reason:** The code uses `buf.split()` and `buf.trimStart()` without proper bounds checking, risking buffer overflows if the calculated indices exceed buffer limits.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Incorrect Conditional Logic
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `(1 == 2)` is used in conditions.
   - **Reason:** The condition `(1 == 2)` is always false, leading to unintended code paths and potentially incorrect behavior.

3. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Incorrect Line Ending Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** The `findEndOfLine` function.
   - **Reason:** The function may not correctly handle all line endings, especially when `terminatorType_` is set to `CARRIAGENEWLINE` or `NEWLINE`, potentially leading to incorrect end-of-line detection.

4. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Redundant","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
