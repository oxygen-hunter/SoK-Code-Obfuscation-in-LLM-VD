16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Memory Corruption:** The third constructor incorrectly initializes `m_Reserved` as pointers, leading to undefined behavior.
   - **Buffer Overflows:** Incorrect calculations and usage of `m_Reserved` pointers cause potential buffer overflows or data corruption.
3. **Reason:** The code contains undefined behavior due to incorrect handling of pointers in the reserved fields and improper string length calculations.","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

",2.0,743.0,6.0,0.9461226463317872
17_comment.cpp,"1. **Vulnerability Identified**: The code has potential security vulnerabilities related to comment parsing and group extraction.

2. **Vulnerability Details**:
   - **Issue with Comment Parsing**: The `getComment` and `collectGroups` functions use regular expressions that might not handle malicious or malformed comments correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or injection attacks.
   - **Group Extraction**: The `createGroup` function could extract unintended parts from comments if the regex pattern is not properly sanitized, leading to incorrect group information.
   - **Line Number Handling**: The `getLineToStop` function might misinterpret line numbers in certain edge cases, affecting the parsing of parameters and descriptions.

3. **Recommendation**: Implement stricter input validation, better sanitization of comments, and use of secure parsing techniques to prevent potential security issues. Additionally, ensure that all input strings are properly validated against known malicious patterns to enhance robustness.","CVE: CVE-2022-0497
CVE Description: A vulnerbiility was found in Openscad, where a .scad file with no trailing newline could cause an out-of-bounds read during parsing of annotations.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
   - **Buffer management issues**: The code may not properly handle buffer trimming, leading to potential buffer overruns or data corruption.  
   - **Integer overflow**: The variable `i` in `findEndOfLineRecursive` is a `uint32_t` that could overflow if the buffer is too large.  
   - **Incorrect terminator handling**: The code may fail to detect certain line endings, leading to incorrect end-of-line detection.  
   - **Resource leaks**: The code may not properly manage discarded bytes or buffers, leading to resource leaks.  
   - **Potential undefined behavior**: The code may loop indefinitely if the terminator isn't found or if buffer checks fail.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
   - Buffer overflow in `fillTable` when the table is smaller than 65536 entries.  
   - Undefined behavior in `fillDitheredTable` when accessing out-of-bounds table indices.  
   - Potential undefined behavior in `getTable` when accessing the table beyond its size.  
   - Reason: The code does not validate the table size against the expected 65536 entries, leading to potential buffer overflows or undefined behavior.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017

80_helper.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Typo in `testFilePath` function:** The else block uses `isSymLink()` instead of `isSymbolicLink()`, which could cause incorrect behavior if a symbolic link is passed.
   - **Missing file creation check:** `prepareBenchmarkFile` and `startBenchmarkTest` do not create the benchmark file if it doesn't exist, which could leave it missing.
   - **Improper error handling:** `flushPageCache` does not handle cases where writing to `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` fails.
   - **Lack of input validation:** The code does not validate file paths, increasing the risk of injection attacks.
   - **Potential unhandled exceptions:** Some file operations and process starts do not catch exceptions, leading to potential crashes or security issues.
   - **Inadequate authorization check:** `isCallerAuthorized` does not check if the helper service itself is authorized, potentially bypassing security checks.
3. **Reason:** The code has multiple security issues such as typos, missing checks, improper error handling, and lack of input validation that could lead to vulnerabilities like injection attacks, file existence issues, and unhandled exceptions.","CVE: CVE-2022-40673
