2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Leak
   Vulnerable Lines: 97
   Reason: The `name` variable is allocated memory using `new` keyword but is not properly deallocated using `delete` before returning from the function, leading to a memory leak.

3. Not Applicable
4. N/A","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

CWE Description: 
",2.0,719.0,6.0,0.6397562026977539
17_comment.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Regular Expression: The code uses the `boost::regex` library which may lead to insecure regular expressions if not properly sanitized. This can lead to vulnerabilities like Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. 
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```cpp
       boost::regex regex(""\\[(.*?)\\]"");
       ```
     - Reason: The regular expression pattern `\\[(.*?)\\]` is susceptible to ReDoS attacks as it uses `.*?` which can cause catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs.
   - Lack of Input Validation: The code does not validate user input before using it in regular expressions, which can lead to security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```cpp
       std::string comment = getComment(fulltext, firstLine);
       ```
     - Reason: The `comment` variable obtained from user input is directly used in regular expressions without proper validation, which can be exploited by an attacker.

3. The code is vulnerable to insecure regular expressions and lacks input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

",2.0,843.0,6.0,0.6998500823974609
46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::decode method
   Reason: The code does not properly handle the case where the length of the frame exceeds the maxLength_. If the length of the frame is greater than maxLength_, the code splits the buffer at the calculated position without proper validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Resource Exhaustion
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::decode method
   Reason: The code does not have proper checks to prevent resource exhaustion. In the case where the length of the buffer exceeds maxLength_, the code trims the buffer and sets discarding_ flag to true, which can lead to resource exhaustion if the condition keeps occurring.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::fail method
   Reason: The code concatenates user input (len) directly into the error message without proper input validation or sanitization. This can lead to potential injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::findEndOfLine method
   Reason: The code does not handle the case where the end of line character is not found within the specified maxLength_. This lack of error handling can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Proper Exception Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::fail method
   Reason: The code creates a runtime_error exception without proper exception handling mechanisms. This can lead to uncaught exceptions and potential security vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service (DoS)
   Vulnerable Lines: 23, 33, 43
   Reason: The code does not have any mechanism to break out of the while loop in the constructors and methods. This can lead to an infinite loop, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

80_helper.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Infinite Loop
   Vulnerable Lines: Multiple while loops in various functions
   Reason: The code contains multiple while loops that have no exit condition other than a return statement within a switch-case block. This can lead to an infinite loop, causing the program to hang or consume excessive resources.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: Various lines throughout the code
   Reason: The code lacks proper error handling mechanisms. For example, file operations are not checked for success or failure, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: Various lines throughout the code
   Reason: The code does not perform sufficient input validation, such as checking user input for malicious or unexpected values. This can lead to security vulnerabilities like command injection or path traversal attacks.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Authorization Checks
   Vulnerable Lines: Various lines throughout the code
   Reason: The code does not consistently perform authorization checks to verify if the caller has the necessary permissions to execute certain operations. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.","CVE: CVE-2022-40673
