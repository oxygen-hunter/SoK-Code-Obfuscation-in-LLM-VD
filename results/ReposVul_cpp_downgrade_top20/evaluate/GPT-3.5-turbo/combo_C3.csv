CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

CWE Description: 
",2.0,1674.0,6.0,0.8744518756866455
17_comment.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 77, 81, 85, 89, 93
   Reason: The `getComment_VM`, `getDescription_VM`, `createGroup_VM`, and `collectGroups_VM` functions use the `fulltext.substr` function with the index obtained from the `program` vector, which is controlled by the input program. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `program` vector to cause buffer overflow or access out-of-bounds memory, leading to code injection vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerability type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable lines: 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71
   Reason: The code does not perform bounds checking when accessing elements in the `stack_` vector. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the stack pointer (`sp_`) is not properly managed and controlled.

3. Vulnerability type: Unhandled Exception
   Vulnerable lines: 77
   Reason: The code throws a `std::runtime_error` without catching or handling it. This can lead to unhandled exceptions and potentially crash the program.

4. Vulnerability type: Insecure Input Handling
   Vulnerable lines: 93
   Reason: The `findEndOfLine` function does not properly validate the input buffer length, which can lead to potential buffer overreads or other security issues.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

   Reason: The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the lack of proper bounds checking in the `compileSetTable` function. The function generates bytecode without verifying the size of the `table` vector, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access and potential exploitation.

   Reason: The code constructs a command to be executed by starting a process with user-controlled input (m_benchmarkFile, fileSize, fillZeros) without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
