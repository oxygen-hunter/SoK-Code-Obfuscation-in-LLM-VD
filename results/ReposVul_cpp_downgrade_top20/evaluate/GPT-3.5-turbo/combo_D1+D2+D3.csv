2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 33
   Reason: The code at line 33 `if (version != (999-999)) return (AP4_HdlrAtom*)0;` is using a constant value for comparison, which can be manipulated by an attacker to bypass the version check and potentially inject malicious code.

CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

17_comment.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Regular Expression: 
     - Line 77: The regular expression pattern `\\[(.*?)\\]` used in the `createGroup` function is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack due to the unbounded repetition `(.*?)`. An attacker can provide a specially crafted input that causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to denial of service.
   - Command Injection:
     - Line 116: The `CommentParser::parser` function is called with user-controlled input `comment` obtained from the `getComment` function. If the `CommentParser::parser` function performs any command execution or system calls based on the input, it could be vulnerable to command injection attacks.

2. Vulnerability Type: Incorrect logic and hardcoded values
   Vulnerable Lines: 14, 22, 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, 73
   Reason: The code contains hardcoded values and incorrect logic conditions that do not make sense and may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, comparisons like `(1 == 2)` and `(not True || False || 1==0)` are not meaningful and can introduce vulnerabilities.

   Vulnerable Line: Line 29
   Reason: The code concatenates strings to form an error message without proper input validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: Line 33
   Reason: The code does not validate the input size of the table, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
