2. Vulnerability Type: License Violation
   Vulnerable Lines: Lines 10-33
   Reason: The code is using Bento4 under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires the code to be distributed under the same license. However, the code mentions ""this version of Bento4 is Bento4|GPL,"" which implies a different license. This discrepancy violates the GPL terms.

CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

CWE Description: 
",1.0,748.0,6.0,1.1232647895812988
17_comment.cpp,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Regular Expression: The code uses the boost::regex library which can be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. The regex pattern ""\\[(.*?)\\]"" used in the function OX3B2A1C9D is susceptible to ReDoS attacks due to the unbounded repetition of the wildcard dot operator. This can cause the application to hang or become unresponsive when processing certain inputs.
     Vulnerable line: `boost::regex OX6E7D8C9B(""\\[(.*?)\\]"");`
     Reason: Unbounded repetition of the wildcard dot operator in the regex pattern.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code does not handle potential ReDoS attacks by limiting the repetition of the wildcard dot operator in the regular expression pattern.

4. Recommendation: Use a more efficient and secure regular expression pattern that does not allow unbounded repetitions, or consider using a different regex library that provides protection against ReDoS attacks.","CVE: CVE-2022-0497

   Vulnerable Line: OX5A6C7E2F(OX7A1B9C6F, ""over "" + OX13F2C4A9::to<std::string>(OX5B9C2E1D));
   Reason: The code concatenates user input directly into the error message without proper validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.
   
3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: OX7A1B9C6F->fireReadException(
   Reason: The code reveals sensitive information about the maximum frame length in the error message, which can aid attackers in crafting malicious requests.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: OX2F8A6B3D = OX1D4C9A2F(OX3B2E1D9A);
   Reason: The code does not validate the input data before processing it, which can lead to buffer overflow or other security issues.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Line: 33, 34
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to writing beyond the bounds of the array `OX9E3D4C1B`. The loop at line 33 writes to `OX9E3D4C1B` without proper boundary checks, potentially causing memory corruption.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 21, 27, 41
   Reason: The code does not validate the input parameters `OX5A1E2D9B`, `OX4C3B8D2A`, and `OX0E1D2B3A` against potential negative values, leading to potential issues like buffer overflows or unexpected behavior.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 13, 29, 43
   Reason: The code throws exceptions without proper error handling mechanisms, which can lead to crashes or unexpected program behavior if exceptions are not caught and handled appropriately.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017

2. Vulnerability type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable lines: 97, 98
   Reason: The code constructs a command to execute the ""fio"" utility with user-provided input without proper input validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized properly.

3. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 125
   Reason: The code writes error messages to the console, potentially leaking sensitive information to an attacker.

4. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability type: Privilege Escalation
   Vulnerable lines: 189-221
   Reason: The code performs authorization checks using PolkitQt1, but the authorization logic is not properly implemented, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

5. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability type: Path Traversal
   Vulnerable lines: 41-57
   Reason: The code does not properly validate user input for file paths, allowing for path traversal attacks.

6. Vulnerable: YES
   Vulnerability type: Denial of Service
   Vulnerable lines: 235-243
   Reason: The code does not handle process termination properly, which can lead to denial of service if the process is not terminated correctly.

7. Vulnerable: YES

   Vulnerable lines: 67-75
   Reason: The code does not validate user input properly, allowing for potential input validation vulnerabilities.

8. Vulnerable: YES

   Reason: The code lacks proper error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

9. Vulnerable: YES
