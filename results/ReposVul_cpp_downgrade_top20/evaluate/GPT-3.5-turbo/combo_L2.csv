16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Leak
   Vulnerable Line: 30
   Reason: The `name` array is allocated dynamically using `new` but is not deallocated using `delete[]` before the function returns. This leads to a memory leak.

3. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 53
   Reason: The calculation of `name_size` does not properly check for buffer overflow, which could lead to writing beyond the allocated memory for `name`.

4. Vulnerability Type: Unvalidated Input
   Vulnerable Line: 53
   Reason: The code does not validate the input `name` before using it, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Regular Expression: 
     - Line 67: The regular expression used in the `createGroup` function (`boost::regex regex(""\\[(.*?)\\]"");`) is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of `.*?` which can cause catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs.
   - Command Injection:
     - Line 116: The `CommentParser::parser` function is called with user-controlled input (`comment`) without proper input validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::decode method
   Reason: The code does not properly handle the case where the length of the frame exceeds the maxLength_ limit. When the frame length exceeds maxLength_, the code splits the buffer at the position of the end of line (eol) without considering the maxLength_ limit. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::fail method
   Reason: The fail method constructs an error message using user input (len) without proper input validation. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::findEndOfLine method
   Reason: The findEndOfLine method does not handle the case where the buffer length exceeds the maxLength_ limit. This can lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service if the buffer length is larger than expected.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Integer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: 7, 20, 29
   Reason: The code does not check for integer overflow when calculating the size of the tables vector. If the product of ntables and TABLE_SIZE exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an int, it can lead to an integer overflow vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Out-of-bounds Write
   Vulnerable Lines: 29
   Reason: The code writes to memory locations beyond the allocated size of the 'tables' vector when setting the table values. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory writes and potential memory corruption.

4. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked Vector Access
   Vulnerable Lines: 20, 29
   Reason: The code does not check if the index 'ntable * TABLE_SIZE' is within the bounds of the 'tables' vector before accessing or writing to it. This can lead to accessing memory out of bounds of the vector and result in undefined behavior.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017

   Reason: The code constructs a command to execute the ""fio"" tool with user-controlled input (benchmarkFile, fileSize, fillZeros). An attacker could manipulate these inputs to inject malicious commands and potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.
