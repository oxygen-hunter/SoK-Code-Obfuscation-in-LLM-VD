2. Vulnerability Type: License Violation
   Vulnerable Lines: Lines 1-29
   Reason: The code mentions the use of Bento4 under the Bento4|GPL license, which is the GNU General Public License (GPL). However, the code does not provide the necessary information about the GPL license terms, such as the version of the GPL license being used, which can lead to potential license compliance issues.

4. N/A","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

CWE Description: 
",1.0,750.0,6.0,0.9601268768310548
17_comment.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 77
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to code injection as it uses the `CommentParser::parser` function to parse the comment obtained from the input text without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the comments, leading to code execution vulnerabilities.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::decode method
   Reason: The code does not properly check the length of the input buffer before processing it, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input exceeds the maxLength limit.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::findEndOfLine method
   Reason: The code does not validate the input buffer for special characters or unexpected input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: LineBasedFrameDecoder::fail method
   Reason: The code does not handle errors properly and may expose sensitive information or cause unexpected behavior when exceptions occur.","CVE: CVE-2019-3563
CVE Description: Wangle's LineBasedFrameDecoder contains logic for identifying newlines which incorrectly advances a buffer, leading to a potential underflow. This affects versions of Wangle prior to v2019.04.22.00

2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 9, Line 17, Line 20, Line 21, Line 22, Line 23, Line 24
   Reason: The code does not perform proper bounds checking when accessing the 'tables' vector. It directly calculates the index using 'ntable*TABLE_SIZE' without verifying if it exceeds the vector's size, leading to potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

3. The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to improper bounds checking when accessing the 'tables' vector.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017

80_helper.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable lines: 77, 78
   Reason: The code constructs a command to be executed by concatenating user-controlled input (benchmarkFile) without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker manipulates the input to execute arbitrary commands.

3. Vulnerability type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable lines: 99
   Reason: The code reveals sensitive information by writing error messages to the console, which can potentially leak information about the system or application to attackers.

4. Vulnerability type: Authorization Bypass
   Vulnerable lines: 123
   Reason: The isCallerAuthorized function does not properly validate the authorization of the caller, allowing potential unauthorized access to sensitive operations.","CVE: CVE-2022-40673
CVE Description: KDiskMark before 3.1.0 lacks authorization checking for D-Bus methods such as Helper::flushPageCache.
