16_Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: 52
   Reason: The code at line 52 uses inline assembly to call a function ""read_ui32"" and manipulate the stream pointer. This is a potential code injection vulnerability as inline assembly can be used to execute arbitrary code.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: 64
   Reason: The code at line 64 reads a name from the stream without proper validation, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing a buffer overflow.

4. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: 77
   Reason: The code at line 77 writes the handler name to the stream without proper length checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the name size exceeds the expected length.","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

   Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Assembly Code
   Vulnerable Line: 6-12
   Reason: The code includes hardcoded assembly code which can introduce security vulnerabilities and make the code less portable and maintainable.

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: `tables.resize(ntables * TABLE_SIZE, ushort16(0));`
   Reason: The `resize` function is used to resize the `tables` vector to a size that is calculated based on the input parameter `ntables`. If `ntables` is a large value, it can lead to a buffer overflow as the vector may be resized to a very large size, causing memory corruption.

3. Vulnerability Type: Uncontrolled Format String
   Vulnerable Line: `ThrowRDE(""Table lookup with %i entries is unsupported"", nfilled);`
   Reason: The `ThrowRDE` function is called with a format string that includes the value of `nfilled` without proper formatting. This can lead to a format string vulnerability if an attacker can control the value of `nfilled`.

4. Vulnerability Type: Use of Inline Assembly
   Vulnerable Line: Inline assembly block starting from `asm (`
   Reason: The use of inline assembly introduces a security risk as it bypasses compiler protections and can lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, code injection, and other memory-related issues. It is recommended to avoid inline assembly whenever possible and use safer alternatives provided by the language.","CVE: CVE-2018-25017
