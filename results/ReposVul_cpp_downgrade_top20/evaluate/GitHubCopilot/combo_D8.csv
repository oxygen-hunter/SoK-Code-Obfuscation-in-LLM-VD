2. - Use-after-free (potential): “m_HandlerName = name+1; … delete[] name;” in AP4_HdlrAtom(..., stream) — if AP4_String does not deep-copy, m_HandlerName references freed memory.
   - Integer precedence bug → size miscalc and possible OOB read/write or excessive padding: “name_size = (AP4_UI08)(m_Size32-AP4_FULL_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE+20);” should be “(AP4_UI08)(m_Size32-(AP4_FULL_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE+20))” in WriteFields; combined with “AP4_FULL_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE+20+name_size > m_Size32” check, this can underflow/overflow.
   - Integer truncation → inconsistent length and OOB read: “(AP4_UI08)m_HandlerName.GetLength()” in WriteFields truncates >255; then Write(m_HandlerName.GetChars(), name_size) may read past buffer.
   - Unchecked I/O → use of uninitialized/partial data: multiple “stream.ReadUI32(...)” and “stream.Read(name, name_size)” have return values ignored in the stream constructor.
   - Null dereference: “return strlen(name);” in getHandlerNameLength if hdlr_name is NULL.
   - Unbounded/attacker-controlled allocation (DoS) and size overflow: “new char[name_size+1]” with name_size from file in stream ctor; “m_Size32 += getHandlerNameLength(hdlr_name)+21;” can overflow m_Size32.

","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.
CWE: ['CWE-119', 'CWE-125']
CWE Description: 
",4.0,984.0,7.0,3.668288469314575
17_comment.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Out-of-bounds read / Undefined Behavior (UB): accessing characters before validating bounds.
     - getLineToStop: while (fulltext[i] != '\n' && i < fulltext.length()) i++; and while (fulltext.compare(i, 2, ""*/"") != 0 && i < fulltext.length()) { if (fulltext[i] == '\n') ...; i++; } — fulltext[i]/compare(...) evaluated before i < length check.
     - collectGroups: identical patterns in '//' skip loop and block comment loop (fulltext[i] and compare(...) used before i < fulltext.length()).
     - getDescription: while (fulltext[start] == ' ' || fulltext[start] == '\t') start++; and while (fulltext[start] != '\n') { ... } — no start < fulltext.length() guard; also compare(start, 2, ""//"") used near end-of-buffer.
   - Unhandled exception DoS: std::string::compare(pos, ...) may throw std::out_of_range when pos > size() due to the same ordering bugs above.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. YES
2. - Potential null dereference/DoS: in findEndOfLine(IOBufQueue& buf) the line “Cursor c(buf.front());” can dereference a null/invalid buffer when buf is empty (no prior empty check), leading to crash.
   - CPU DoS (algorithmic): in findEndOfLine the loop “for (uint32_t i = 0; i < getMaxLength() && i < buf.chainLength(); i++) { auto b = c.read<char>(); … }” scans up to maxLength bytes per call; an attacker can send extremely long lines without a terminator to force repeated O(n) scans and high CPU usage.
   - Boundary/policy weakness: in decode the check “if (eol > maxLength_)” allows a frame of exactly maxLength_ bytes (without delimiter) to pass, which may violate intended “max length” policy if it was meant to be strict (>=); this can be abused to bypass an expected limit by 1 byte.
3. N/A
4. For the null-dereference risk, if folly::IOBufQueue::front() is guaranteed non-null even when empty in your exact version, that specific issue would not apply; otherwise it is exploitable.

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES.
2. Vulnerabilities: (a) Out-of-bounds read when table is empty because the only guard is assert(!table.empty()) which is removed in release; subsequent uses table[nfilled - 1] and table[i] in both branches (non-dither loop t[i] = ... table[nfilled - 1]; dither loops use table[i±1] and table[nfilled - 1]) can index -1; (b) Out-of-bounds read/write due to improper table index validation: if (ntable > ntables) and if (n > ntables) allow ntable == ntables and any negative values, then getTablePointer returns &tables[n * getTableSize()] (unchecked operator[]) leading outside the vector; (c) Integer overflow in size/index math: tables.resize(getDynamicTableSize(), ...) where getDynamicTableSize() is ntables * getTableSize(), and &tables[n * getTableSize()] can overflow int, causing undersized allocation and subsequent memory corruption; (d) Integer underflow/overflow to unsigned: t[i * 2] = center - ((upper - lower + 2) / 4) and t[i * 2 + 1] = delta assign possibly negative or large ints to ushort16, causing wrap-around.
