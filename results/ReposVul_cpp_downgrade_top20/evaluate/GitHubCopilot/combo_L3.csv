2. Vulnerabilities:
   - CWE-252 (Unchecked return values) and CWE-125/CWE-457 (Out-of-bounds read / Use of uninitialized memory)
     - Vulnerable lines: in AP4_HdlrAtom::AP4_HdlrAtom(AP4_UI32 size, AP4_UI08 version, AP4_UI32 flags, AP4_ByteStream& stream): stream.ReadUI32(predefined); stream.ReadUI32(m_HandlerType); stream.ReadUI32(m_Reserved[0]); stream.ReadUI32(m_Reserved[1]); stream.ReadUI32(m_Reserved[2]); stream.Read(name, name_size);
     - Reason: All stream reads ignore return codes; short/failed reads lead to using uninitialized fields and partially-filled buffers, which can propagate garbage data and potentially leak memory contents via m_HandlerName.
   - CWE-789 (Uncontrolled memory allocation / DoS)
     - Vulnerable line: char* name = new char[name_size+1];
     - Reason: name_size is derived from attacker-controlled atom size; a large size can trigger excessive allocation and memory exhaustion.
   - CWE-197 (Integer truncation)
     - Vulnerable lines: AP4_UI08 name_size = (AP4_UI08)m_HandlerName.GetLength(); and later casts/size math in WriteFields
     - Reason: Truncates lengths >255, causing inconsistent serialization (length mismatch) and potential logic errors when writing fields.
   - CWE-252 (Unchecked write results)
     - Vulnerable line: while (padding--) stream.WriteUI08(0);
     - Reason: Write result is ignored, masking I/O errors and leaving corrupted output state.

","CVE: CVE-2017-14643
CVE Description: The AP4_HdlrAtom class in Core/Ap4HdlrAtom.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 uses an incorrect character data type, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_BytesToUInt32BE in Core/Ap4Utils.h.

17_comment.cpp,"1. YES.
2. Vulnerabilities: (a) CWE-125 Out-of-bounds read in getLineToStop and collectGroups: while(fulltext[i] != '\n' && i < fulltext.length()) and while(fulltext.compare(i,2,""*/"") != 0 && i < fulltext.length()) evaluate fulltext[i]/compare before checking bounds, and later checks like if(fulltext[i]=='{') can run with i == fulltext.length() (unterminated comments or end-of-buffer trigger OOB); (b) CWE-125 Out-of-bounds read in getDescription: while(fulltext[start] == ' ' || fulltext[start] == '\t') and while(fulltext[start] != '\n') lack start < fulltext.length() guard (a final line without a trailing '\n' reads past end); (c) CWE-190/681 Integer overflow/truncation: using int for indices (e.g., int end = start+1 with start from size_t) can overflow on large inputs and lead to invalid indexing.

46_LineBasedFrameDecoder.cpp,"1. YES.
2. Out-of-bounds read (buffer over-read): in findEndOfLine, the line using ""*c.peekBytes().data()=='\n'"" can dereference an empty ByteRange at a buffer boundary (e.g., '\r' at end of one IOBuf and '\n' in the next), leading to undefined behavior/DoS or potential memory disclosure because size is not checked before dereference.

57_TableLookUp.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Out-of-bounds access (off-by-one and missing negative checks):
     - Vulnerable lines: ""if (ntable>ntables){...} ushort16* t=&tables[ntable*TABLE_SIZE];"", ""if (n>ntables){...} return &tables[n*TABLE_SIZE];""
     - Reason: Allows ntable==ntables and n==ntables (should be >=), and no check for negative values; both can index past/before the vector.
   - Out-of-bounds read when input table is empty in release builds:
     - Vulnerable lines: ""assert(!table.empty());"" and uses of ""table[nfilled-1]"" in both branches (e.g., ""(i<nfilled)?table[i]:table[nfilled-1];"", ""t[i*2]=...; ... for (i=nfilled; i<65536) { t[i*2]=table[nfilled-1]; }"")
     - Reason: assert is removed in release, so empty input makes nfilled==0 and accesses table[-1].
   - Potential DoS/overflow risk with size calculations:
     - Vulnerable lines: ""tables.resize(ntables*TABLE_SIZE,...)"" and index computations ""&tables[ntable*TABLE_SIZE]""
     - Reason: Uses int for size arithmetic; very large ntables can overflow int or cause excessive allocation leading to memory exhaustion.

2. - TOCTOU symlink race → lines: Helper::testFilePath(...) vs subsequent QProcess launches in Helper::prepareBenchmarkFile(...) and Helper::startBenchmarkTest(...): reason: path is checked for symlink once, but attacker can replace it with a symlink before fio opens it, enabling arbitrary file overwrite as root.
   - Insufficient path validation/arbitrary file creation → lines: Helper::testFilePath(...) only enforces suffix ""/.kdiskmark.tmp"" and “not /dev”; reason: authorized caller can target any directory (e.g., “/etc/.kdiskmark.tmp”), enabling privileged file creation and potential system interference/DoS.
   - Use-after-free of QProcess pointer → lines: lambdas in Helper::prepareBenchmarkFile(...) and Helper::startBenchmarkTest(...) capture m_process and read from it after Helper::stopCurrentTask() deletes m_process; reason: dangling pointer on finished signal can cause crashes or exploitable UAF.
   - DoS via unbounded user-controlled parameters → lines: Helper::startBenchmarkTest(...) passes measuringTime, fileSize, blockSize, queueDepth, threads, rw directly to fio; reason: excessive values can exhaust I/O/CPU/memory or destabilize the system.
