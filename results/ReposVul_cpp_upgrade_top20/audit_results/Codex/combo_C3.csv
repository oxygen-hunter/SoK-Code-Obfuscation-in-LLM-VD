      - Type: Out-of-bounds write — combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:56 — The VM’s STORE handler writes to memory[bytecode[pc+  
        +]], but memory is an empty std::vector<int> (declared at combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:75 and never resized).       
        Executing the bytecode immediately issues STORE 0, so the first write dereferences memory[0] and corrupts memory.  
      - Type: Out-of-bounds read — combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:53 — The VM’s LOAD handler likewise reads from
        memory[bytecode[pc++]] before the vector has any elements, so the crafted bytecode used in AP4_AvccAtom::Create    
        triggers an invalid read from memory[0], again causing memory corruption.

2. - Stack underflow → undefined behavior / DoS: `VM::run` (case `POP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JZ`, `STORE`, `RET`) at `VM::run` lines 20-69 pop or read `m_stack` without checking `m_stack.empty()`, so crafted bytecode can force an empty stack access and crash the VM.  
   - Out-of-bounds read of program bytecode: `VM::run` (case `PUSH`, `JMP`, `JZ`, `LOAD`, `STORE`, `CALL`) at lines 17-65 fetch operands with `m_program[++m_pc]` without ensuring `m_pc + 1 < m_program.size()`, letting malformed bytecode read past the vector and trigger undefined behavior.

2. - Heap-based buffer overflow — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:60` and `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:64`; `SimpleVM::LOAD`/`STORE` index the zero-length `memory` vector with operand-controlled values, allowing out-of-bounds reads/writes that can corrupt memory.
   - Stack underflow leading to undefined behavior — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:27`, `:31`, `:32`, `:34`, `:41`, `:42`, `:53`, `:64`, `:65`, `:75`, `:76`; multiple opcodes (`POP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JZ`, `STORE`, `RET`) call `stack.back()`/`stack.pop_back()` without checking stack depth, so crafted bytecode can trigger empty-stack access and crash the process (DoS).
   - Out-of-bounds bytecode read — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:23`, `:49`, `:52`, `:60`, `:64`, `:69`; operand fetches use `bytecode[++pc]` without confirming that another element exists, so truncated or malicious bytecode can read beyond the vector bounds and cause undefined behavior.

2. - Type: Stack underflow / unchecked stack access; Lines: `main.cpp:28`, `main.cpp:30`, `main.cpp:36`, `main.cpp:38`, `main.cpp:47`, `main.cpp:60`; Reason: Calls to `stack.top()` and `stack.pop()` assume data is present, so crafted bytecode can trigger empty-stack reads leading to undefined behavior or crashes.  
- Type: Out-of-bounds memory access; Lines: `main.cpp:55`, `main.cpp:60`; Reason: `memory[index]` is used without verifying `index < memory.size()`, enabling reads/writes past the vector bounds.  
- Type: Out-of-bounds bytecode access / control-flow corruption; Lines: `main.cpp:22`, `main.cpp:44`, `main.cpp:47`; Reason: Operand fetches and jump targets are taken directly from untrusted bytecode, so malformed values can make `pc` negative or beyond `bytecode.size()`, causing invalid memory access and execution of unintended data.

- Type: Out-of-bounds read/write (CWE-787); Lines: `VM::execute` at `main.cpp:20`, `main.cpp:38`, `main.cpp:43`, `main.cpp:49`, `main.cpp:50`, `main.cpp:51`; Reason: Each case dereferences `memory[++pc]`/`memory[memory[++pc]]` with no bounds verification. With `vm.memory = {0,0,0}` the third instruction (`LOAD`) immediately touches `memory[3]`, triggering undefined behaviour; crafted bytecode/memory values can corrupt state or crash the process.  
- Type: Stack underflow leading to DoS (CWE-703); Lines: `VM::execute` at `main.cpp:21`, `main.cpp:23`, `main.cpp:25`, `main.cpp:31`, `main.cpp:33`, `main.cpp:40`, `main.cpp:41`, `main.cpp:50`, `main.cpp:52`; Reason: `std::stack::top()`/`pop()` are invoked without first ensuring the stack holds the required operands. Malicious or malformed programs can empty the stack and force these calls, resulting in undefined behaviour or termination.
