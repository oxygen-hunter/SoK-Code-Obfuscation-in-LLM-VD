      - Type: Integer underflow / uncontrolled allocation — combo_C2/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:134 — Subtracts
        AP4_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE from attacker‑controlled size without first checking that size ≥ header. Because this         
        happens in an unsigned context, a truncated atom (size < header) wraps the result to a huge payload_size, forcing  
        payload_data.SetDataSize and stream.Read to attempt massive allocations/reads, enabling denial‑of‑service.         
      - Type: Out-of-bounds read / null dereference — combo_C2/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:147 — Immediately dereferences payload[0]
        before confirming that any payload bytes were fetched; a crafted atom with zero payload leads to reading past the  
        buffer (or dereferencing a null pointer), crashing the parser.

","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.
CWE: ['CWE-119', 'CWE-125']
CWE Description: 
",4.0,853.0,7.0,1.282024621963501
33_TypedArray.cpp,"1. NO  
3. The implementation validates both the byte offset and length against the ArrayBuffer’s size, ensures required alignment, and relies on `Checked<size_t>` arithmetic to detect and reject any overflow before using the values. No unsafe memory access, overflow, or exception-handling flaws are evident in the provided code paths.
","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
CVE Description: A vulnerability was found in SerenityOS. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer in the library Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-222074 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

53_cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp,"1. YES  
2. - CWE-190 Integer Overflow → CWE-122 Heap Buffer Overflow — `cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:74-75` — `data_size - 1024` is a `uint64_t`, but it is truncated to `int` when sizing `seg_data`. If the segment exceeds `INT_MAX + 1024`, `SetSize` allocates too small a buffer while `ReadFromFile` still copies the full (large) length, overrunning the heap.  
   - CWE-190 Integer Overflow → CWE-122 Heap Buffer Overflow — `cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:139-157` — `nAllocBufSize` is stored in a 32-bit `unsigned int`. Large inputs wrap the multiplication `512 * nNumBlocks` to a much smaller value, yet `memcpy` and `memset` operate on the original `nBufSize`, writing past the allocated buffer.

CVE Description: GDAL 3.3.0 through 3.4.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow in PCIDSK::CPCIDSKFile::ReadFromFile (called from PCIDSK::CPCIDSKSegment::ReadFromFile and PCIDSK::CPCIDSKBinarySegment::CPCIDSKBinarySegment).

**Findings**
- Integer overflow → heap buffer overflow (CWE-190/CWE-122); p_tmt.cpp:146, p_tmt.cpp:147, p_tmt.cpp:149; `ih.imagesize` and `ih.relocsize` come straight from the attacker-controlled file header and the 32-bit additions `usize + rsize + 128` / `rsize + EXTRA_INFO + 4` can wrap, so the subsequent `readx` and `memcpy` invocations overflow the undersized buffers.
- Integer underflow → out-of-bounds access (CWE-191/CWE-125); p_tmt.cpp:233, p_tmt.cpp:235, p_tmt.cpp:241; the unpack path trusts `ph.u_len` from the packed file and uses `obuf + ph.u_len - 4/8/12` without verifying that `ph.u_len` covers the trailer, so crafted headers make the pointer arithmetic underflow and `osize = ph.u_len - tail` wrap, driving the decompressor and filter to touch memory outside the allocated buffer.
","CVE: CVE-2023-23456

    playlist’s NumberOfEntries value. A malicious file can provide a negative or extremely large number; when converted to 
    size_t, the vector attempts to reserve that much memory and exhausts the process.

    combo_C2/72_PlayListPLS.cpp:161; the fileN/titleN/lengthN keys are parsed with atoi into a size_type index without     
    bounds checking. Negative or very large indices become massive unsigned values, and Resize(idx) then grows m_vecItems  
    toward that size (by repeated pushes), consuming enormous memory and hanging or crashing the application.
