      - Type: Out-of-bounds write — combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:56 — The VM’s STORE handler writes to memory[bytecode[pc+  
        +]], but memory is an empty std::vector<int> (declared at combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:75 and never resized).       
        Executing the bytecode immediately issues STORE 0, so the first write dereferences memory[0] and corrupts memory.  
      - Type: Out-of-bounds read — combo_C3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:53 — The VM’s LOAD handler likewise reads from
        memory[bytecode[pc++]] before the vector has any elements, so the crafted bytecode used in AP4_AvccAtom::Create    
        triggers an invalid read from memory[0], again causing memory corruption.

","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

33_TypedArray.cpp,"1. YES
2. - Stack underflow → undefined behavior / DoS: `VM::run` (case `POP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JZ`, `STORE`, `RET`) at `VM::run` lines 20-69 pop or read `m_stack` without checking `m_stack.empty()`, so crafted bytecode can force an empty stack access and crash the VM.  
   - Out-of-bounds read of program bytecode: `VM::run` (case `PUSH`, `JMP`, `JZ`, `LOAD`, `STORE`, `CALL`) at lines 17-65 fetch operands with `m_program[++m_pc]` without ensuring `m_pc + 1 < m_program.size()`, letting malformed bytecode read past the vector and trigger undefined behavior.
","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
CVE Description: A vulnerability was found in SerenityOS. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer in the library Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-222074 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

53_cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp,"1. YES
2. - Heap-based buffer overflow — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:60` and `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:64`; `SimpleVM::LOAD`/`STORE` index the zero-length `memory` vector with operand-controlled values, allowing out-of-bounds reads/writes that can corrupt memory.
   - Stack underflow leading to undefined behavior — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:27`, `:31`, `:32`, `:34`, `:41`, `:42`, `:53`, `:64`, `:65`, `:75`, `:76`; multiple opcodes (`POP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JZ`, `STORE`, `RET`) call `stack.back()`/`stack.pop_back()` without checking stack depth, so crafted bytecode can trigger empty-stack access and crash the process (DoS).
   - Out-of-bounds bytecode read — `segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:23`, `:49`, `:52`, `:60`, `:64`, `:69`; operand fetches use `bytecode[++pc]` without confirming that another element exists, so truncated or malicious bytecode can read beyond the vector bounds and cause undefined behavior.

2. - Type: Stack underflow / unchecked stack access; Lines: `main.cpp:28`, `main.cpp:30`, `main.cpp:36`, `main.cpp:38`, `main.cpp:47`, `main.cpp:60`; Reason: Calls to `stack.top()` and `stack.pop()` assume data is present, so crafted bytecode can trigger empty-stack reads leading to undefined behavior or crashes.  
- Type: Out-of-bounds memory access; Lines: `main.cpp:55`, `main.cpp:60`; Reason: `memory[index]` is used without verifying `index < memory.size()`, enabling reads/writes past the vector bounds.  
- Type: Out-of-bounds bytecode access / control-flow corruption; Lines: `main.cpp:22`, `main.cpp:44`, `main.cpp:47`; Reason: Operand fetches and jump targets are taken directly from untrusted bytecode, so malformed values can make `pc` negative or beyond `bytecode.size()`, causing invalid memory access and execution of unintended data.

With `vm.memory = {0,0,0}` the third instruction (`LOAD`) immediately touches `memory[3]`, triggering undefined behaviour; crafted bytecode/memory values can corrupt state or crash the process.

Malicious or malformed programs can empty the stack and force these calls, resulting in undefined behaviour or termination.
