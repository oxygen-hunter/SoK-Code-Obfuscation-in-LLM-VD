      - Type: Integer underflow / uncontrolled allocation — combo_D1+D2+D3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:67 — Subtracts the constant  
        (900+100)/2 (500) from the untrusted atom size before validating it. Typical atoms are far smaller than 500        
        bytes, so attacker-supplied sizes cause the unsigned subtraction to wrap, yielding a huge payload_size, forcing    
        AP4_DataBuffer and stream.Read to attempt massive allocations/reads (denial of service or crash).                  
      - Type: Out-of-bounds read — combo_D1+D2+D3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:73 — Immediately dereferences payload[0] without      
        confirming that any payload bytes were read. A crafted atom whose size is ≤500 (triggering the underflow above)    
        leaves the buffer empty, so the read crosses the allocation boundary and dereferences invalid memory.
      - Type: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic — combo_D1+D2+D3/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:49 — Returns 'B' + ""aseline"" (and       
        similar expressions for other profiles), which adds a non-zero integer to the base address of the string literal.  
        That produces a pointer far past the literal’s storage; when later dereferenced (for logging/inspection), it reads 
        arbitrary memory, leading to undefined behavior and potential crash controlled by the attacker-chosen profile      
        value.

","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
CVE Description: A vulnerability was found in SerenityOS. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer in the library Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-222074 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

53_cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp,"1. YES
2. - heap buffer overflow — segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:59-64. `nNumBlocks` is an `int` derived from attacker-controlled `nBufSize`; the multiplication `(5*100+12) * nNumBlocks` is performed in signed `int` arithmetic. For sufficiently large inputs this overflows and produces a much smaller `nAllocBufSize`, yet `memcpy` still copies `nBufSize` bytes, so the write runs past the allocated heap buffer (potential RCE).
   - denial of service — segment/cpcidskbinarysegment.cpp:34. The expression `'t' + 'oo ' + 'large data' + ""_size""` adds large integers to the `""_size""` pointer, yielding an invalid pointer that is passed into `ThrowPCIDSKException`. When error handling is triggered (e.g., by malformed input), the runtime will dereference this bogus pointer and crash the process.

        combo_D1+D2+D3/56_p_tmt.cpp:123, combo_D1+D2+D3/56_p_tmt.cpp:125: the code adds attacker-controlled header fields  
        ih.imagesize (usize) and ih.relocsize (rsize) before allocating ibuf, obuf, and mb_wrkmem. These values are only   
        checked against the file length, so a crafted header can choose usize + rsize near UINT_MAX, making the unsigned   
        addition wrap. The buffers become far smaller than the subsequent fi->readx(..., usize) and fi->readx(..., rsize)  
        copies, leading to out-of-bounds writes, crash, or potential code execution when processing a malicious input file.
