        combo_L8/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:140; Reason: payload_size is computed as size-AP4_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE before confirming   
        size >= AP4_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE, so a crafted atom with a smaller size wraps the unsigned subtraction and forces      
        AP4_DataBuffer/m_RawBytes.SetData to attempt an enormous allocation, exhausting memory.

        checking that the payload actually contains at least one byte, enabling truncated streams to trigger a read past   
        the supplied buffer.                                                                                               
      - Type: Out-of-bounds read; Locations: combo_L8/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:88, combo_L8/23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:162; Reason:      
        payload[cursor++] is evaluated before ensuring cursor < payload_size, allowing malformed length fields to advance  
        cursor to the end and then read beyond the payload before the subsequent bounds check executes.  
","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

- `py_initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer` (`py_initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer` function : lines 74-88) — Type confusion / arbitrary pointer dereference: untrusted Python integers are blindly converted with `PyLong_AsVoidPtr` and reinterpreted as `GlobalObject*`, `TypedArrayBase*`, `ArrayBuffer*`, and `Value*`, then dereferenced or used for virtual calls. An attacker can supply crafted integers to trigger memory corruption or execute code.  
- `py_initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer` (`py_initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer` function : lines 74-88) — Missing error handling / denial of service: the return values of `PyLong_AsVoidPtr` are never checked for `PyErr_Occurred()`. On conversion failure the function uses `(void*)-1`, leading to dereference of an invalid pointer and crashing the process.
","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
CVE Description: A vulnerability was found in SerenityOS. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer in the library Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-222074 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

An attacker-controlled or corrupted segment can set `data_size < 1024`, making `data_size - 1024` negative; `ctypes.create_string_buffer` then raises, causing the process to abort.
