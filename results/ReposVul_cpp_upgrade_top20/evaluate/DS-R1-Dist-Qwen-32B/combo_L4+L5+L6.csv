23_Ap4AvccAtom.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**
   - **Stack Overflow Due to Recursion:** The code uses recursive functions (e.g., `SequenceParamsCursor`, `ParseSequenceParameters`) which can cause stack overflow if the number of parameters is excessively large, leading to a denial of service.
   - **Potential Buffer Overflow:** Functions like `ParseSequenceParameters` may not correctly handle all edge cases, risking buffer overflows if payload data is malformed or unexpectedly large.

3. **Explanation:**
   - **Stack Overflow:** Recursive functions without proper bounds checking can exhaust the stack, especially with deeply nested or numerous parameters. This is a critical issue in security as it can lead to application crashes or potential code execution.
   - **Buffer Overflow Risks:** Incorrect handling of payload sizes and parameter lengths may allow attackers to craft inputs that exceed buffer limits, leading to memory corruption and potential code injection.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Replace recursive functions with iterative approaches to prevent stack overflow.
   - Implement strict bounds checking and use safe memory operations to mitigate buffer overflow risks.
   - Validate and sanitize all input data to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sizes.

**Conclusion:** The code contains security vulnerabilities primarily related to stack overflow and buffer overflow risks, which can be exploited to cause application crashes or more severe security breaches.","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

33_TypedArray.cpp,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Integer Overflow:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
       - Line where `new_byte_length = new_length * element_size;` is calculated without prior overflow check.
     - **Reason:** If `new_length` is very large, multiplying by `element_size` could cause an integer overflow, leading to undefined behavior or potential security exploits.

   - **Division by Zero:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
       - The check `if (buffer_byte_length % element_size != 0)` when `buffer_byte_length` is zero.
     - **Reason:** If `buffer_byte_length` is zero, attempting to divide by `element_size` could result in a division by zero error, causing a crash or unexpected behavior.

3. **Recommendations:**

   - **Add Overflow Checks:**
     - Before performing the multiplication `new_length * element_size`, implement an overflow check to ensure the result does not exceed the maximum value for `size_t`.

   - **Handle Zero Buffer Length:**
     - Add a condition to check if `buffer_byte_length` is zero before performing any division operations to prevent division by zero errors.

   - **Use Checked Arithmetic:**
     - Utilize the `Checked<size_t>` type consistently in all arithmetic operations to automatically detect and handle overflows.

By addressing these issues, the code can be made more robust against integer overflow attacks and unexpected crashes due to division by zero.","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
