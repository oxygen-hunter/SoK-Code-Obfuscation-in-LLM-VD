CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

CWE Description: 
",3.0,1671.0,6.0,0.9697756767272948
33_TypedArray.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Stack-based buffer overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: `m_stack.push(m_program[++m_pc]);` and `m_stack.push(m_program[++m_pc]);` in cases PUSH
   Reason: The code does not perform bounds checking before pushing elements onto the stack, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow if the program tries to access elements beyond the bounds of the `m_program` vector.

3. Vulnerability Type: Uninitialized memory read
   Vulnerable Line: `auto b = m_stack.top();` in cases ADD and SUB
   Reason: The code reads the top element from the stack without checking if there are enough elements in the stack. This can lead to reading uninitialized memory if the stack is empty or does not contain enough elements.

4. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked array access
   Vulnerable Line: `m_stack.push(m_memory[addr]);` in case LOAD
   Reason: The code accesses the `m_memory` unordered map without checking if the `addr` key exists in the map. This can lead to accessing uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.

5. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked array access
   Vulnerable Line: `m_memory[addr] = m_stack.top();` in case STORE
   Reason: The code accesses the `m_memory` unordered map without checking if the `addr` key exists in the map. This can lead to accessing uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.

6. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked array access
   Vulnerable Line: `m_pc = m_program[++m_pc] - 1;` in case JMP and JZ
   Reason: The code directly accesses the `m_program` vector without checking if the index is within bounds. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the vector.

7. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked array access
   Vulnerable Line: `m_pc = m_program[++m_pc] - 1;` in case CALL
   Reason: The code directly accesses the `m_program` vector without checking if the index is within bounds. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the vector.","CVE: CVE-2021-4327

2. Vulnerability Type: Stack Overflow
   Vulnerable Lines: `stack.push(memory[++pc]);` and `stack.push(a + b);` in the `execute` method of the `VM` class.
   Reason: The code does not check if the stack is full before pushing elements onto it, which can lead to a stack overflow if the stack size exceeds its capacity.

3. Vulnerability Type: Uninitialized Memory
   Vulnerable Lines: `vm.memory = {0, 0, 0};` in the `Load` and `Save` methods of the `PlaylistVM` class.
   Reason: The memory is being initialized with hardcoded values without proper initialization or allocation, which can lead to reading or writing to uninitialized memory locations.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: `playlist.Load(""example.pls"");` and `playlist.Save(""output.pls"");` in the `main` function.
   Reason: The code does not validate the input file names before using them, which can lead to potential security risks such as path traversal attacks or file manipulation vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2021-42917
