   - Reason: 
     - Incorrect logic in setting `loaded_` and `mbModified` variables.
     - Hardcoded credentials in the form of `(1==2) && (not True || False || 1==0)` and `(1==2) || (not False || True || 1==1)`.

CVE Description: GDAL 3.3.0 through 3.4.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow in PCIDSK::CPCIDSKFile::ReadFromFile (called from PCIDSK::CPCIDSKSegment::ReadFromFile and PCIDSK::CPCIDSKBinarySegment::CPCIDSKBinarySegment).

",4.0,1170.0,6.0,0.761383056640625
56_p_tmt.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: #define EXTRA_INFO ((1<<2) - (1<<0))
   Reason: The EXTRA_INFO macro is defined using bit manipulation without any validation or sanitization, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if user input is directly used in this macro.

3. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Line: addLoader(""IDENTSTR,TMTMAIN1"", ph.first_offset_found == ((0<<1) + (1<<0)) ? ""TMTMAIN1A"" : """", ""TMTMAIN1B"", ft->id ? ""TMTCALT1"" : """", ""TMTMAIN2,UPX1HEAD,TMTCUTPO"", nullptr);
   Reason: The addLoader function call concatenates strings without proper input validation, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks if untrusted input is passed.

4. Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: fi->readx(h, sizeof(h));
   Reason: The readx function reads data into the buffer 'h' without checking the size of the input data, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input data exceeds the buffer size.

5. Vulnerability Type: Uncontrolled Format String
   Vulnerable Line: printWarn(getName(), ""bad header; imagesize=%#x  entry=%#x  relocsize=%#x"", imagesize, entry, relocsize);
   Reason: The printWarn function uses format strings with user-controlled data without proper validation, which can lead to uncontrolled format string vulnerabilities.

6. Vulnerability Type: Integer Overflow
   Vulnerable Line: cconf.conf_lzma.max_num_probs = ((1<<10) + (1<<9) + (1<<8) + (1<<7) + (1<<6) + (1<<5) + (1<<4) + (1<<3) + (1<<2) + (1<<1) + (1<<0)) + ((0<<1) + (1<<9) + (1<<8) + (1<<7) + (1<<6) + (1<<5) + (1<<4));
   Reason: The calculation of 'cconf.conf_lzma.max_num_probs' can result in integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type.

7. Vulnerability Type: Unvalidated Input
   Vulnerable Line: if (find_le32(ibuf, UPX_MIN((0x80), usize), get_le32(""U"" ""PX "")) >= (0<<1))
   Reason: The find_le32 function is called with user-controlled input 'ibuf' without proper validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

8. Vulnerability Type: Unchecked Return Value
   Vulnerable Line: fi->readx(ibuf, usize);
   Reason: The return value of the readx function is not checked for errors, which can lead to undetected issues if the read operation fails.

9. Vulnerability Type: Insecure File Operations
   Vulnerable Line: fo->write(&oh, sizeof(oh));
   Reason: The write operation to the output file 'fo' is performed without proper error handling or validation, which can lead to insecure file operations or unexpected behavior.

10. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Sanitization
    Vulnerable Line: ft.init(ph.filter, (0<<1));
    Reason: The 'ph.filter' value is directly passed to the 'ft.init' function without proper input sanitization, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not validated.

11. Vulnerability Type: Unrestricted File Access
    Vulnerable Line: fo->write(obuf, osize);
    Reason: The write operation to the output file 'fo' does not enforce any restrictions on file access, which can lead to unrestricted file access vulnerabilities if the file path is not properly validated.

12. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Memory Bounds Checking
    Vulnerable Line: set_le32(wrkmem + ic * ((0<<1) + (1<<2)), get_le32(wrkmem + ic * ((0<<1) + (1<<2))) + ((0<<1) + (1<<2)));
    Reason: The calculation in the set_le32 function does not include proper bounds checking, which can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities if the index exceeds the buffer size.
