2. Vulnerability Type: License Violation
   Vulnerable Lines: 8-29
   Reason: The code is using Bento4 under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires the code to be distributed under the same license. However, the code mentions that it is distributed under Bento4|GPL, which is not a recognized version of the GPL. This discrepancy could lead to a license violation.

2. Vulnerability Type: Memory Corruption
   Vulnerable Lines: 23, 37, 47, 53, 61, 67, 75, 81, 87
   Reason: The code lacks proper boundary checks and error handling for various operations involving memory allocation and manipulation. This can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or underflows.

56_p_tmt.cpp,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: #define EXTRA_INFO 4 // original entry point
   Reason: The EXTRA_INFO constant is defined with a fixed value of 4, which could potentially be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious code or alter the behavior of the program.

3. Vulnerability Type: Unvalidated Input
   Vulnerable Line: if (memcmp(h, ""MZ"", 2) == 0)
   Reason: The code compares the input data with a fixed string ""MZ"" without validating the input data, which could lead to buffer overflow or other security issues if the input data is not properly sanitized.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: if (memcmp(h, ""Adam"", 4) == 0)
   Reason: The code checks for a specific string ""Adam"" without proper input validation, which could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the program flow or cause unexpected behavior.","CVE: CVE-2023-23456
