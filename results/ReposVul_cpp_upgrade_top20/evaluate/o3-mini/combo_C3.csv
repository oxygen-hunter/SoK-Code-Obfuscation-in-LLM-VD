   a. Unchecked Bytecode Access and Indexing (Out‐of‐Bounds Memory Access in VM::Execute)
      - Vulnerable Lines: In the VM::Execute() method – for example, the instructions handling PUSH (e.g. “stack.push_back(bytecode[pc++]);”), JMP (“pc = bytecode[pc];”), CALL (“pc","CVE: CVE-2017-14646
CVE Description: The AP4_AvccAtom and AP4_HvccAtom classes in Bento4 version 1.5.0-617 do not properly validate data sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash in AP4_DataBuffer::SetData in Core/Ap4DataBuffer.cpp.

33_TypedArray.cpp,"1. YES

2. Vulnerabilities detected:

• Stack Underflow Errors  
 – Vulnerable Lines:  
  • In the POP instruction (e.g., line with “case POP:” where m_stack.pop() is called)  
  • In the ADD instruction (lines where m_stack.top() is called twice and then m_stack.pop() is invoked)  
  • In the SUB instruction (similarly calling m_stack.top() and m_stack.pop())  
  • In the JZ instruction (calling m_stack.top() and m_stack.pop())  
  • In the RET instruction (using m_stack.top() and m_stack.pop())  
 – Reason:  
  The code performs pop and top operations on m_stack without checking if the stack is empty. If the VM’s bytecode does not guarantee that the stack has the required number of elements when these operations execute, it will lead to undefined behavior (stack underflow), which may be exploited.

• Out‐of‐Bounds Memory Access on Program Vector  
 – Vulnerable Lines:  
  • Instructions such as PUSH (""m_program[++m_pc]""), JMP (""m_pc = m_program[++m_pc] - 1;""), JZ (where m_program[++m_pc] is used), LOAD (""","CVE: CVE-2021-4327
CVE Description: A vulnerability was found in SerenityOS. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function initialize_typed_array_from_array_buffer in the library Userland/Libraries/LibJS/Runtime/TypedArray.cpp. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The patch is identified as f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-222074 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.

2. Vulnerabilities detected:

   • Unchecked Stack Operations  
     - Vulnerable “lines”: In the switch cases for POP, ADD, and SUB (e.g., the lines where stack.pop_back() and stack.back() are called).

2. Vulnerabilities found:

72_PlayListPLS.cpp,"1. YES

2. Vulnerabilities found:

   a. Unchecked Memory Access (Out-of-Bounds Read/Write)
      - Vulnerable Lines: 
          • In the PUSH case: ""stack.push(memory[++pc]);""
          • In the JMP, JZ, LOAD, STORE, and CALL cases: any expression that does ""memory[++pc]"" and ""memory[memory[++pc]]"" or ""memory[memory[++pc]] = ..."" 
      - Reason: The code assumes that the ""memory"" vector always has an element at the index computed by ""++pc"" or at the index stored in ""memory[++pc]"". There is no check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the ""memory"" vector. This can lead to out‐of‐range accesses and undefined behavior which could be exploited if the program is built from untrusted input.

   b. Unchecked Stack Operations (Stack Underflow)
      - Vulnerable Lines:
          • In the POP case: ""stack.pop();""
          • In the ADD and SUB cases: usage of ""stack.top()"" and subsequent ""stack.pop()"" without ensuring that the stack contains the required number of elements.
          • In the CALL and RET cases: reliance on ""stack.top()"" to retrieve the return address without checking if the stack is non‐empty.
