   - **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure JWT Decryption  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Line 28: `OX6C5D4E3F.decode(OX7B8A9C0D[""id_token""], verify=False)`  
     - **Reason**: The code incorrectly uses the OAuth token (OX7A6B5C4D) instead of the client secret (OX7E6D5C4B) to decode the JWT. This allows an attacker who possesses the token to bypass the signature verification, leading to potential session hijacking or unauthorized access.  

2. **Other Considerations**:  
   - The application does not validate the CSRF token on incoming requests, relying solely on the state parameter, which may not be sufficient for all scenarios.  
   - The client secret is stored in memory and used correctly in some parts of the code, but its usage in the JWT decoding step is flawed.  
   - The application does not enforce HTTPS for the OAuth callback endpoint, which could",1530,1024,20.62517809867859

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: The code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, which can lead to SQL injection attacks. For example, the line `OX6F7A8B9C = ""SELECT * FROM users WHERE "" + OX5B6C7D8E` is prone to SQL injection if `OX5B6C7D8E` contains untrusted input.

2. **Exposure of Sensitive Data**: The GET route returns user data in the response, which could expose sensitive information if the group name is known.

3. **Potential SQL Injection in User Data Handling**: In the PUT route, userids are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, which could allow injection if the data is untrusted.

**Vulnerable Lines:**

2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **SQL Injection**:  
     - **Lines**: `/create` route, `/poll` route, `/show` route, `/refresh` route.  
     - **Reason**: The code constructs SQL statements using untrusted user inputs without proper escaping, leading to potential SQL injection attacks. For example, in the `/create` route, the code uses `request.remote_addr` directly in an SQL query without sanitization. Similarly, the `/poll` route uses user input in a SELECT statement without escaping, and the `/show` and `/refresh` routes also use untrusted data in SQL queries.  
   - **Insecure Database Connection**:  
     - **Lines**: Multiple places where the database connection is used.  
     - **Reason**: The database connection is kept open after each query, which could lead to resource exhaustion. Additionally, the database credentials are hardcoded, which is insecure if the credentials are exposed.  
   - **Missing Input Validation**:  
     - **Lines**: Multiple routes where user input is used without validation.  
     - **Reason**: The code does not validate or sanitize user inputs, making it vulnerable to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Command Injection.  
   - **Missing CSRF Protection**:

150_website.py,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities:

1. **Insecure Storage of Roblox Cookies**: The configuration file stores Roblox cookies in plain text, exposing sensitive data.
2. **Missing Authentication for API Routes**: Some endpoints lack proper authentication, risking unauthorized access.
3. **Lack of Rate Limiting**: Multiple endpoints could be exploited through abuse without rate limiting.
4. **Temporary Verification Keys**: Storing temporary keys without protection increases the risk of misuse.
5. **Potential Initialization Issues**: The bot's startup and shutdown handling might lead to race conditions.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Insecure Cookie Storage**: The code stores Roblox cookies in `config.json`, which is read directly. This exposes sensitive data if the file is compromised.
2. **Missing Auth Checks**: Routes like `/v1/products` and `/v1/create_product` lack essential authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Without rate limits, endpoints like `/v1/verify_user` and `/v1/give_product` can be exploited to cause DoS or financial issues.
4. **Temporary Key Storage**: The verification key is stored in memory, which is safer but lacks long-term protection against key theft.
5. **Bot Initialization**: Using `run_task` might not handle server startup correctly, potentially causing issues during runtime.

**Recommendations:**

- **Secure Sensitive Data**: Use secure storage for Roblox cookies and API keys.
- **Implement Authentication**: Add proper auth mechanisms to all API routes.
- **Add Rate Limiters**: Control the number of requests per endpoint to prevent abuse.
- **Secure Temporary Keys**: Ensure temporary data is handled safely, possibly using secure in-memory storage with expiration.
- **Review Initialization**: Ensure the bot initializes correctly to avoid runtime issues.

   - **Insecure Object Creation**: The `OX3B2A4C1D` class's `__init__` method may allow the creation of arbitrary objects if `OX2B1C3A4` is user-controlled, leading to potential vulnerabilities like CSRF or command injection.

3. **Reasoning**:  
   - **String Injection**: The `%(truncated_text)s` format string in `OX1E3D2C4B` could be exploited if the `truncated_text` parameter is not properly controlled, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary text into the output.  
   - **Insecure Object Creation**: The `super().__init__(lambda: str(OX2B1C3A4))` in `OX3B2A4C1D` could create objects based on user-provided data, which might expose the application to CSRF or other attacks if not properly validated.

4. **Mitigation**:  
   - For string injection, ensure that all user-controlled inputs are properly sanitized before being used in string formatting.  
   - For object creation, validate that `OX2B1C3A4` is a trusted source and avoid allowing arbitrary object creation from untrusted inputs.",5235,916,21.82162117958069

3. **Why Not Vulnerable:** The code correctly uses ecrecover in most places and has proper assertions for testing. The primary issue is the type mismatch in the ecrecover call.",1343,987,22.623746395111084
206__mlflow_pyfunc_backend_predict.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** NO
2. **Reason:** The code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. It correctly uses argparse to handle command-line arguments and passes them to the _predict function. There are no signs of SQL injection, command injection, or path traversal vulnerabilities. The content-type argument is handled but lacks validation, which could be a concern depending on the model's usage, but no immediate security risk is apparent.",401,722,16.370620012283325
207_dremio_handler.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES  
   The code contains several security vulnerabilities.  
   
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Hardcoded Credentials**: The password is hardcoded as 'password' in the `OX8A7B6C5D` method.  
   - **SQL Injection Risk**: The `OX1F2E3D4C` method does not sanitize user input before executing SQL queries, which could allow SQL injection.  
   - **Exposure of Internal Information**: The `OX9E8D7C6B` method queries the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, potentially exposing internal database information.  
   - **Exposure of Column Details**: The `OX3A2B1C4D` method runs a `DESCRIBE` statement, which could expose column details.  

3. **Reason for Vulnerability:**
   - **Hardcoded Credentials**: Hardcoding sensitive information like passwords is a major security risk as it can be easily exploited.  
   - **SQL Injection**: Without proper input validation, malicious input can execute unintended SQL commands.  
   - **Exposure of Internal Information**: Querying internal schema information can reveal sensitive database details.  
   - **Exposure of Column Details**: Running `DESCRIBE` can reveal column names and data types, which might be considered sensitive or internal.",2674,700,14.336783647537231
208_test_structure_exception.py,"The code provided is a test suite using pytest to check for potential issues when compiling various Vyper code snippets. It does not contain any direct security vulnerabilities but is designed to detect vulnerabilities in the code being tested. The test uses parametrized test cases to check for exceptions during compilation, ensuring that the Vyper compiler correctly identifies issues in the code.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **SQL Injection**  
     - **Lines:** OX7E1D9B2A = OX5B2E8D4C  
     - **Reason:** The code directly uses OX7E1D9B2A in a User.objects.filter() without sanitization, which could allow SQL injection if OX7E1D9B2A is user-controlled or comes from an untrusted source.  
   - **Command Injection**  
     - **Lines:** send_mail(*args, **kwargs)  
     - **Reason:** The *args passed to send_mail could contain malicious content, potentially leading to command injection.  
   - **File Deletion Vulnerability**  
     - **Lines:** os.remove(OX9B7C6E2F)  
     - **Reason:** The loop in OX3C5E7F8B can delete files based on user-controlled data, posing a risk of unintended file deletion.  

3. **Reason:** The code lacks proper input sanitization and validation, leading to potential security risks.",825,872,18.081942319869995
