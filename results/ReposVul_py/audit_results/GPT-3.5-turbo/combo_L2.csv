1. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Information Leakage
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 68
   - **Reason:** The error message in the `oauth_callback` function directly displays the error parameter from the request args without proper sanitization. This can potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as the error message is not properly escaped.

2. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Input Validation
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 77
   - **Reason:** The code does not validate the `code` parameter obtained from the request args before using it to fetch the access token. This can lead to potential security issues if the `code` is manipulated or tampered with.

3. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Error Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 86
   - **Reason:** The code does not handle the case where the response from fetching the user profile is not successful (status code other than 200). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

4. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Authorization
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 94
   - **Reason:** The code does not perform any authorization checks before fetching the user profile using the access token. This can lead to unauthorized access to user profiles.

5. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Communication
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 101
   - **Reason:** The code makes a request to the profile URL without verifying the SSL certificate. This can expose the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

6. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Error Logging
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 108
   - **Reason:** The code does not log the error details properly when authentication fails. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues and identify potential security threats.

7. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of CSRF Protection
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 33
   - **Reason:** The `login` function does not include any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms. This can make the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

8. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Session Management
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 36
   - **Reason:** Storing the `next` URL in the `flask_session` without proper validation or expiration can lead to session fixation attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive URLs.

9. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Redirect
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 45
   - **Reason:** The `redirect` function in the `login` function does not validate or sanitize the `oauth_url` before redirecting. This can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities.

10. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Configuration
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 20-29
    - **Reason:** The OAuth configuration parameters (client_id, client_secret, etc.) are stored in the code directly, which can expose sensitive information. It is recommended to store such sensitive information securely, such as using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.

11. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Proper Exception Handling
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 99

     - Vulnerable lines: 20, 45, 56, 67, 78
     - Reason: The code does not perform sufficient input validation on user inputs received via HTTP requests. This can lead to various security issues such as unexpected behavior, data corruption, or injection attacks.
   - Lack of Error Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 45, 67, 78
     - Reason: The code lacks proper error handling mechanisms. In case of exceptions or errors, the code does not handle them gracefully, which can lead to information disclosure or service disruption.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement input validation to sanitize and validate user inputs.
   - Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Implement proper error handling to handle exceptions and errors securely.

         cur.execute(""SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname=%s;"", (db_name, ))
         ```
         Reason: The query is vulnerable to SQL injection as the `db_name` parameter is directly interpolated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

   Vulnerable lines:
   - Line 3: `from lxml.etree import XMLParser as _UnsafeXMLParser`
   - Line 9: `def parse_xml(source: Union[AnyStr, IO[Any]], recover: bool = False):`

   Reasons:
   - The code imports `_UnsafeXMLParser` from `lxml.etree`, which can potentially lead to insecure XML parsing if not handled properly.
   - The `parse_xml` function lacks input validation for the `source` parameter, which can lead to various security vulnerabilities like XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if user-controlled input is passed.

   - Insecure Cryptographic Hash Function: The code uses the SHA-1 hash function for generating the signature in the `validate` method. SHA-1 is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. It is recommended to use a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3.
     - Vulnerable lines: 41
     - Reason: SHA-1 is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to its vulnerability to collision attacks.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code uses the SHA-1 hash function which is known to be weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness: The `generate_key` function uses the `secrets.token_bytes` function to generate a random key. However, the `secrets` module is not suitable for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use the `secrets` module for generating secure tokens. Vulnerable lines: 26, 27. Reason: Insecure randomness can lead to predictable keys, which can be exploited by attackers.
   - Lack of Input Validation: The `get_object_from_key` function does not validate the `confirmation_type` input parameter. This can lead to potential issues if an attacker provides unexpected input. Vulnerable line: 47. Reason: Lack of input validation can result in unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
   - Missing CSRF Protection: The code does not include any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms. CSRF protection should be implemented to prevent CSRF attacks. Reason: Missing CSRF protection can expose the application to CSRF attacks.

3. Recommendation:
   - Use a secure random number generator like `secrets.token_urlsafe` for generating secure tokens.
   - Implement input validation for the `confirmation_type` parameter in the `get_object_from_key` function.
   - Implement CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent CSRF attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `relay_from_id` function at line 41. The function returns a Relay object based on the relay_id provided in the request. However, it first checks the static_relays dictionary for the relay_id and if not found, it queries the Relay model directly. This can lead to an IDOR vulnerability as an attacker may be able to manipulate the relay_id to access unauthorized relays.

   - In the `generate` method, the line `PasseoPassword = ''.join(secrets.choice(password) for i in range(length))` is vulnerable because `secrets.choice` expects a sequence, but `password` is a string. It should be `PasseoPassword = ''.join(secrets.choice(password) for i in range(length))`.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `elif y == None:` will never be reached because `requests.get` will either return a response object or raise an exception. So, the condition should be removed.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `elif length == None:` will never be reached because the length of a string will always be an integer. So, the condition should be removed.
   - In the `generate` method, the conditions `if password.lower():`, `elif password.upper():`, and `elif password.lower() and password.upper():` are incorrect for checking if a password contains lowercase or uppercase letters. It should be `if password.islower():`, `elif password.isupper():`, and `elif password.islower() and password.isupper():` respectively.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `return str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Pwned']) + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Length'] + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Case']) + '\n' + 'The Passeo password strength test has ended. Any questions/bugs? Raise a issue on https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/issue.')` is vulnerable because of the incorrect concatenation of strings. It should be `return str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Pwned']) + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Length']) + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Case']) + '\n' + 'The Passeo password strength test has ended. Any questions/bugs? Raise an issue on https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/issue.'`.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Storage: The code stores passwords using a custom hashing scheme `pbkdf2_sha256`, which is not recommended. It is better to use industry-standard hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for secure password storage. Storing passwords using a custom scheme can lead to security vulnerabilities.

       - Line 123: The `hash_password` method is called to hash the password before storing it.
       - Line 147: The `hash_password` method is called to hash the password before storing it.
   - Lack of Password Salting: The code does not use a unique salt for each password hash, which can make the system vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 38: The `hash_password` method does not use a unique salt for each password hash.
   - Lack of Password Policy Enforcement: The code does not enforce strong password policies such as complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters), which can weaken the overall security of the system.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 50: The `_min_password_length` and `_max_password_length` variables define the password length constraints, but additional password complexity requirements are not enforced.

3. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to insecure password storage, lack of password salting, and lack of password policy enforcement.
