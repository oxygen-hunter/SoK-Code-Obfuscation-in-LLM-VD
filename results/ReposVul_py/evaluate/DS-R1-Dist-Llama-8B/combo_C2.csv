No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

This can lead to incorrect parsing of regex patterns, potentially allowing unintended permissions or bypassing security checks. Additionally, using `ConfigParser.readfp` may not correctly handle multi-line regex patterns, which could result in malformed regex being used, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Regex Injection  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where user input is used in regex patterns without proper escaping.  
   - **Reason**: The code uses `re.escape` on user and collection URLs, which helps prevent direct injection, but if the regex patterns themselves are not properly constructed or if there are any syntax errors, it could lead to unintended regex behavior, potentially allowing injection of malicious patterns.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Path Traversal

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability in `get_logs` Method**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where the query is constructed dynamically without proper parameterization.
   - **Reason**: The method constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, which can lead to SQL injection if user-controlled parameters are not properly sanitized.

2. **Predictable Session IDs**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The `new_session` method uses `randbits(32)` to generate session IDs.
   - **Reason**: Predictable session IDs can be exploited for session hijacking if the session cookie is not properly encrypted and signed.

3. **Hardcoded Username**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Usage of the fixed username 'kenny2scratch' in multiple methods.
   - **Reason**: A known username can be a weak point if it's exposed, leading to potential unauthorized access.

4. **Inadequate Session Management**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Methods like `new_client` and `get_client` handle sessions without proper anti-fixation or randomization.
   - **Reason**: This can lead to session replay attacks if session tokens are not properly protected.

5. **Resource Leak in `close` Method**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The `close` method may not properly close all database connections.
   - **Reason**: Unreleased database connections can cause resource exhaustion or connection leaks.

6. **Inadequate Ban Handling**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Methods `get_ban` and `del_ban` do not check if a user is already un-banned.
   - **Reason**: This can lead to duplicate or unnecessary deletions, potentially causing data integrity issues.

**Conclusion**: The code is vulnerable due to the identified issues. To fix these, implement proper input sanitization, use secure session management practices, and ensure resource cleanup.","CVE: CVE-2020-26236
CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - Missing CSRF protection in the `dispatch` method, which can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
   - The `validate_request` method in `AnymailBaseWebhookView` does not properly validate the request, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **CSRF Protection Missing**: The `dispatch` method uses `@csrf_exempt`, which disables CSRF protection. This can allow attackers to perform actions like creating or deleting data via POST requests without validation.
   - **Incomplete Validation**: The `validate_request` method in `AnymailBaseWebhookView` has an empty implementation, which doesn't properly validate the request or stop after the first check, leading to potential unauthorized access.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Command Injection and Information Leak
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines 28-30 in `create_ticket` and lines 117-119 in `close_ticket`
   - **Reason:** The code uses `str.format()` on user-provided data in a way that could allow command injection. For example, in `create_ticket`, the `default_message_ticket_channel.format()` method is called with `member=SafeMember(author)`, which might expose internal attributes or allow arbitrary code execution if the format string is manipulated. Similarly, in `close_ticket`, the `channel.edit()` call uses a format string that could be unsafe.

2. **Vulnerability Type:** Insecure Attribute Access
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines 28-30 in `SafeMember.__getattr__`
   - **Reason:** The `__getattr__` method returns an empty string for any unknown attribute, which could lead to unintended information leaks if an attacker accesses non-existent attributes of a `SafeMember` instance.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

1. **Exposed Session Keys**: The `ViewsTest` class has a test that creates a session with the key 'ABC123' and checks if it appears in the response. This exposes session keys to the frontend, allowing potential session hijacking.

2. **Missing Authentication in Tests**: Some test methods lack proper authentication checks, which could allow unauthorized access to certain functionalities.

3. **Exposure of Internal IPs**: The `AdminTest` class tests for sessions with specific IPs, potentially exposing internal IPs that shouldn't be publicly accessible.

4. **Bypassing Authentication Checks**: The `test_login_signal` method uses a mock to trigger the user_logged_in signal without proper authentication, which could bypass security checks.

5. **Session Restoration Test**: The `test_restore_session` method might expose internal session data if not properly handled.

6. **Exposed User Data in Admin**: The `test_search` method in `AdminTest` filters sessions by the username, potentially exposing user-specific data.

7. **Insecure Device and Location Data**: The `LocationTemplateFilterTest` and `DeviceTemplateFilterTest` reveal user locations and device information, which could be sensitive.

8. **Potential Command Injection**: The `MigratesessionsCommandTest` might allow command injection if not properly secured.

**Recommendations**:
- **Session Key Exposure**: Use a more secure method to handle session management and avoid exposing keys.
- **Authentication in Tests**: Ensure all tests requiring authentication include proper login steps.

All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

110_app.py,"The code has several security vulnerabilities:

1. **Insecure Database Credentials**: The database connection uses the root user with an empty password, which is a significant security risk.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**: Multiple routes do not sanitize user inputs, allowing potential XSS attacks.
3. **Insecure State Management**: The application's state handling in certain routes could be manipulated, leading to potential issues.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

- **Insecure Database Credentials**: The code connects to the database using `root` with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access if the database is exposed.
- **XSS Risks**: User inputs in routes like `/poll`, `/show`, and `/refresh` are directly used in rendering templates without sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **State Handling Issues**: The `do_poll` and `show` routes do not validate `p_id`, potentially allowing manipulation.

**Recommendations:**

- **Secure Database Access**: Use a non-root user with a strong password.
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Use Flask's `escape` function to prevent XSS.
- **Validate State Transitions**: Ensure state transitions are secure to prevent state manipulation.

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: Multiple places use string formatting in SQL queries without proper parameterization, allowing potential injection.
2. **Resource Leaks**: Connections are not properly closed, leading to possible resource exhaustion.
3. **Improper Connection Handling**: Connections are created but not managed correctly, increasing the risk of leaks or errors.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

- **SQL Injection**: In functions like `check_db_or_user_exists` and `create_postgres_db`, SQL statements use `%s` formatting with user inputs, which can be exploited if the inputs aren't sanitized. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL commands.
  
- **Connection Leaks**: Connections are often opened but not closed properly, especially in error cases, leading to resource leaks and potential crashes.

- **Connection Handling Issues**: The code doesn't handle cases where the database or user might not exist when attempting deletion, which can cause errors or unintended behavior.

**Vulnerable Lines and Reasons:**

1. **check_db_or_user_exists**:
   - Lines where SQL queries use `%s` without parameterization.
   - Reason: Direct string interpolation in SQL statements allows SQL injection.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

   - **YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Potential Command Injection
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines 1-3 in `with_ssh_tunnel` function
   - **Reason:** The `with_ssh_tunnel` function allows dynamic execution of arbitrary code through the `f` function, which could potentially lead to command injection if not properly sanitized.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The `with_ssh_tunnel` function uses a decorator that wraps a function `f` and modifies the query runner's `host` and `port` during execution. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the `f` function's arguments or context, potentially leading to command injection if the function is not properly controlled or validated.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Restrict the allowed functions or arguments that can be passed to `f`.
   - Use proper input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from affecting the function's behavior.
   - Consider using a more secure method for tunneling or restricting the use of SSH tunnels to trusted environments.","CVE: CVE-2021-43780
CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

   - Lines where `self.cmdline_args` is being built in both `prepare_plugin_docs_command` and `prepare_plugin_list_command` methods. Specifically, when user-provided inputs like `plugin_names`, `module_path`, or `playbook_dir` are directly appended to the command without sanitization.  
   - The issue arises because the code doesn't validate or sanitize the user inputs, allowing malicious strings to be injected into the command line arguments. This can lead to executing unintended or harmful commands.  

2. **Reason**: The code constructs command-line arguments without proper validation, allowing command injection. For example, if `plugin_names` contains malicious content, it could execute arbitrary commands.","CVE: CVE-2021-4041

   **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**  
     - **Lines:** 29-31, 41-43, 57-59  
     - **Reason:** The `read_from_format_instruction` method does not properly validate the `string_length_size` parameter. If an attacker can manipulate this value, it may cause the code to read beyond the intended data length, leading to buffer overflows or information leaks. Similarly, the `write_from_format_instruction` method does not check the length of strings being written, which could cause memory exhaustion or overflow issues.

2. **Explanation:**  
   - The `read_from_format_instruction` method uses the `string_length_size` to read a certain number of bytes. If this value is not validated against the actual data length, it can lead to reading past the end of the stream, causing buffer overflow.  
   - The `write_from_format_instruction` method writes data without checking the length of strings, which could exhaust memory or cause overflow if the string is too long.

CVE Description: Dispatch is an open source security incident management tool. The server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message when the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin encounters an error when attempting to decode a JWT token. Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs. If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file. This issue has been addressed in commit `b1942a4319` which has been included in the `20230817` release. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

   - **Lines:** 13-15 (The `is_equal` function)
   - **Reason:** The custom `is_equal` function uses XOR to compare bytes, which is not a secure method for password validation. It doesn't account for all possible password scenarios, such as different character encodings or lengths, leading to potential authentication bypasses.

3. **Other Issues:**
   - The state machine in both `login` and `create_user` methods may not handle all edge cases, potentially leading to unintended exceptions or user registration issues.

The primary issue is the insecure password comparison method, which could allow users to bypass authentication checks.","CVE: CVE-2014-125056

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Session Fixation or Manipulation

   - **Reason:** Assigning multiple methods like `__delitem__`, `clear`, `pop`, etc., to `__setitem__` can cause unintended behavior, potentially leading to session fixation or data loss.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The issue arises because in Python, when you assign multiple methods to `__setitem__`, any operation that modifies the dictionary might trigger these methods, which could clear or alter the session data unexpectedly. This can lead to session fixation, where the session isn't properly updated or is cleared under certain conditions, compromising the security of the application's session handling.

   - Avoid assigning multiple methods to `__setitem__` in the `SecureCookieSession` class. Instead, use appropriate methods for each operation to prevent unintended side effects on the session data.","CVE: CVE-2023-30861
CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

206__mlflow_pyfunc_backend_predict.py,"The code is vulnerable because it does not validate the `input_path` argument, which could lead to path traversal or command injection attacks.

1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Path Traversal/Injection  
   - **Lines**: `input_path=args.input_path if args.input_path else None`  
   - **Reason**: The `input_path` is used directly without validation, allowing malicious input that could lead to file traversal or command injection.
3. **Other Considerations**: The `content-type` argument is also not validated, but the immediate risk is lower compared to the unvalidated `input_path`.","CVE: CVE-2023-3765

207_dremio_handler.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   - **SQL Injection**: Lines 39-40 in native_query method.  
     - **Reason**: The code directly uses the query parameter without proper sanitization, allowing potential SQL injection attacks.  
   - **Improper JSON Data Handling**: Lines 24-25 in connect method.  
     - **Reason**: Using data= instead of json= can lead to improperly encoded data, potentially exposing sensitive information.  

2. **Explanation**:  
   - **SQL Injection**: The query parameter is used directly in the POST request without escaping or sanitizing it, which can allow attackers to execute malicious SQL commands.  
   - **Improper JSON Handling**: Using data= can lead to issues if the string contains quotes or special characters, as it doesn't ensure proper JSON formatting. This might expose sensitive data or cause request failures.  

3. **Recommendations**:  
   - **Sanitize the query parameter**: Use an ORM or proper escaping to prevent SQL injection.  
   - **Use json= for data**: This ensures the data is properly JSON-encoded, preventing issues with special characters.","CVE: CVE-2023-38699
CVE Description: MindsDB's AI Virtual Database allows developers to connect any AI/ML model to any datasource. Prior to version 23.7.4.0, a call to requests with `verify=False` disables SSL certificate checks. This rule enforces always verifying SSL certificates for methods in the Requests library. In version 23.7.4.0, certificates are validated by default, which is the desired behavior.

209_tasks.py,"The code contains a potential security vulnerability related to file deletion when handling email attachments. Specifically, the `send_mail_attachment_async` function uses `os.remove(attachment)` without proper validation, which could allow an attacker to delete unintended files if they provide malicious attachments.

1. **Vulnerable Code:**
   - **Lines 28-30** in `send_mail_attachment_async`:
     ```python
     for attachment in attachment_list:
         email.attach_file(attachment)
         os.remove(attachment)
     ```
   - **Reason:** Using `os.remove(attachment)` without validating the source of `attachment` can lead to unintended file deletions if `attachment_list` contains malicious filenames or paths.

2. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Recipient List Validation:** The code doesn't validate the `recipient_list`, which could lead to unintended recipients receiving emails. However, this is more of an operational issue than a direct security vulnerability.

**Conclusion:** The primary security issue is the potential for malicious file deletion due to the unsafe use of `os.remove()`.","CVE: CVE-2023-46138
CVE Description: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. Prior to version 3.8.0, the default email for initial user admin is `admin[@]mycompany[.]com`, and users reset their passwords by sending an email. Currently, the domain `mycompany.com` has not been registered. However, if it is registered in the future, it may affect the password reset functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.8.0 by changing the default email domain to `example.com`. Those who cannot upgrade may change the default email domain to `example.com` manually.
