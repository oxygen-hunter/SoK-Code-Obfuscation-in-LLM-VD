2. **Vulnerabilities Type**: Path Traversal
3. **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 52-63 in `static_view.py` (get_resource_name method)
4. **Reason**: The code constructs resource paths without properly validating against path traversal attacks, allowing attackers to access unintended files or directories.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Path Construction**: The `get_resource_name` method constructs `resource_path` by joining `self.docroot` with `path` from the request. This can be manipulated if `path` contains directory traversal sequences like '..' or '.'.
- **Path Validation**: The `_secure_path` function checks for invalid characters but may not correctly handle all path traversal vectors, especially when `path_tuple` contains '..' or '.'.
- **Potential Exploit**: An attacker can provide a malicious path that navigates beyond the intended directory, exposing sensitive files or allowing access to unintended resources.

**Fixes:**

1. **Improve Path Validation**: Use a more robust path validation function that correctly handles all path traversal elements.
2. **Sanitize Input Paths**: Ensure all user-controlled paths are sanitized before use.
3. **Use Safe Path Functions**: Utilize functions like `os.path.relpath` or similar that handle normalization and prevent traversal.

**Conclusion**: The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient path validation, allowing attackers to access unintended files or directories.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins.

User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code.

3. **Inadequate Permission Checks**: The `_get_credentials` method retrieves credentials without verifying if the user has the right permissions, and the `_assert_owner` method only checks if the user ID matches, not their role or privileges, which could allow unauthorized access.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Predictable Secrets**: Using `uuid.uuid4().hex` for secrets is insecure because it's predictable. This can be brute-forced, leading to potential unauthorized access.
  
- **Stack-Based Code Execution**: The VirtualMachine's operations allow for stack manipulation, which could be exploited to alter the program flow, potentially leading to code injection or unintended execution paths.

- **Insufficient Permission Checks**: The methods don't adequately check if users have the necessary permissions beyond ownership, allowing potential privilege escalation or unauthorized credential access.

**Recommendations:**

1. Replace predictable secret generation with a more secure method, such as using a secure random string with a higher entropy or a hashing algorithm.

2. Implement additional checks in `_get_credentials` and `_assert_owner` to ensure users have the required permissions, possibly by fetching the user's roles and verifying against them.

   - **Type**: Command Injection  
   - **Lines**: Lines 13-14 and 20-21 in `vm_exec_cmd` function  
   - **Reason**: The code does not properly sanitize input arguments, allowing command injection via untrusted data in `args` and `kwargs`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution.

2. **Explanation**:  
   - In `vm_exec_cmd`, the code constructs a program that directly uses `args` and `kwargs` without sanitization. If `args` or `kwargs` contain malicious data, it can execute arbitrary commands, posing a significant security risk. For example, if `args` contains `--execute 'rm -rf /'`, it would execute this command during the VM's execution. Similarly, untrusted keyword arguments could be injected. This lack of input validation allows attackers to manipulate the Chef commands, leading to potential system compromise.

3. **Recommendation**:  
   - Sanitize all input arguments and keyword arguments before using them in the VM program. Use functions like `salt.utils.sanitize` to clean the inputs to prevent command injection. Additionally, validate that all user-provided data is properly escaped and checked for malicious content before inclusion in system commands.","CVE: CVE-2015-1839

Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

86_DataSourceLXD.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution**:  
     - **Lines**: 1-3, 7-9, 13-15, 21-23, 27-29, 35-37, 43-45, 49-51, 57-59, 65-67  
     - **Reason**: The code uses a custom VM interpreter that allows untrusted code execution. The `run_vm_program` function executes arbitrary code in a virtual machine, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if not properly sanitized. The `jmp` and `jz` functions allow control flow changes without proper validation, making it possible for an attacker to execute malicious code.  

2. **Insecure Network Request Handling**:  
   - **Lines**: 70-73, 77-79, 85-87  
   - **Reason**: The `_do_request` function uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests but lacks proper error handling and input validation. This could allow injection of malicious data or code. Additionally, the `requests.Session()` is used without proper configuration, which might expose sensitive information.  

3. **Insecure File Handling**:  
   - **Lines**: 9-11, 17-19, 25-27  
   - **Reason**: The code uses `os.path.exists` and `os.lstat` functions without proper validation. This could allow path traversal or access to unintended files.  

4. **Insecure YAML/JSON Parsing**:  
   - **Lines**: 23-25, 33-35, 41-43  
   - **Reason**: The code parses YAML and JSON data without proper validation, which could lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.  

**Recommendation**: The code should be refactored to use a safer language or a more secure VM interpreter. Input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent arbitrary code execution and other vulnerabilities. Proper error handling for network requests and file operations is also crucial.","CVE: CVE-2023-1786

   **Vulnerability Type:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)  
   **Vulnerable Lines:**  
   - Lines where `self.client.get` and `self.client.post` are used without CSRF tokens in test programs.  
   **Reason:** The code uses `self.client.get` and `self.client.post` in test programs without including CSRF tokens. This could allow Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if the application doesn't properly handle these requests, leading to unintended actions like deleting users.

2. **Explanation:**  
   The test cases simulate HTTP requests using `self.client.get` and `self.client.post` without including CSRF tokens. In a real application, each form submission or state-changing HTTP request should include a CSRF token to prevent CSRF attacks. Without this protection, an attacker could exploit these test cases to perform actions they shouldn't, such as deleting users.","CVE: CVE-2023-45809
CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

1. **Session Cookie Handling**: The test_unmodified_session method checks for the presence of the session cookie, which could expose sensitive session data if not properly secured.

2. **User-Agent Manipulation**: The test_long_ua method sends a very long User-Agent string, which might not be properly sanitized, potentially leading to injection or denial of service (DoS) attacks.

3. **Session Modification**: The test_modify_session method might allow unintended session modifications if the URL or user agent isn't properly validated.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

- **Session Cookie Vulnerability**: The test_unmodified_session method checks if the session cookie is present after a request. If the session isn't properly secured, an attacker could hijack the session, leading to potential security breaches.

- **User-Agent Manipulation**: The test_long_ua method sends a long string as the User-Agent header. If the system doesn't sanitize this input, it could allow injection of malicious data, potentially leading to security issues or information leaks.

- **Session Modification Test**: The test_modify_session method might allow unintended session changes if the URL or user agent isn't validated, which could lead to session hijacking or data tampering.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Secure Session Cookies**: Ensure that session cookies are marked as Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite to prevent session hijacking.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference).

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API.

2. **Vulnerability Explanation:**  
   - The `compile_RouterAjax` function uses raw `request.GET` parameters in SQL queries without proper escaping, allowing attackers to manipulate the database queries through user input. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of the database.

3. **Other Potential Issues:**  
   - **XML Parsing Vulnerability:** In `compile_NiceRideAjax`, the code uses `ET.fromstring()` on user-provided XML data without proper validation, which could lead to XML injection if the data is malformed or controlled by an attacker.  
   - **Missing Error Handling:** Some functions like `ET.fromstring()` and database operations don't have proper error handling, which could lead to crashes or unintended behavior.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use parameterized queries or ORM methods in Django to prevent SQL injection.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

This allows an attacker to manipulate the resolver, leading to potential DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. Additionally, the use of `time.time()` without a high-resolution timer could enable timing attacks.

1. **DNS Rebinding Vulnerability**: The `iterate_nameservers` method resets the resolver to the current nameserver in each iteration, allowing an attacker to control the resolver and potentially alter DNS responses.
2. **Predictable Timing**: The use of `time.time()` without a high-resolution timer could expose timing information, enabling attackers to guess parts of the timestamp.

- `ReverseLookup.iterate_nameservers`: Similar lines where `dns_resolver.nameservers = [ns]` is used.

**Reasoning**:
- **DNS Rebinding**: By setting `nameservers` to the current iterator's nameserver, the code allows an attacker to override the resolver, leading to potential DNS spoofing.
- **Predictable Timing**: Using `time.time()` without a high-resolution clock makes it easier for attackers to guess timing information, which can be used in side-channel attacks.

CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

   - **Type**: Command Injection  
   - **Lines**: `_ConnectionMetadata.extra_dejson` property and the VM processing logic.  
   - **Reason**: The `extra_dejson` property uses a VM to process user-provided data without proper validation, allowing potential command injection through JSON parsing. The code might execute arbitrary commands if `self.extra` contains malicious content, posing a security risk.

2. **Vulnerability Explanation**:  
   The `extra_dejson` method constructs a list of instructions that can be influenced by the `self.extra` value. If `self.extra` is a string, it's pushed onto the stack and then processed. This can lead to command injection if the string is crafted to execute malicious code upon being parsed by `json.loads`. The `JZ` instruction checks if the value is 7, which might not be a sufficient safeguard, allowing the code to execute if the value matches, leading to potential system compromise.

3. **Recommendation**:  
   Sanitize the `extra` data before processing it in the VM. Use secure methods to parse and validate the data to prevent command injection and ensure only trusted data is processed. Additionally, consider removing or restricting the use of `json.loads` if it's not necessary, or use a safer alternative for deserialization.","CVE: CVE-2023-25956

CVE Description: Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position.

The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.
