0_util.py,"1. **Vulnerability Found: Thread Safety Issue with ThreadPoolExecutor**

   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - Lines where `ThreadPoolExecutor` is initialized in `initialize_rpc_threadpool()`.
     - `_async` function where `thread.daemon` is set.

   - **Reason:**
     The code uses a global `global_rpc_threadpool` which is a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. However, the `max_workers` parameter is taken from `prefs.get_remote_pool_max_threads()`, which might not be properly validated or constrained, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or thread safety issues. Additionally, the `_async` function sets `thread.daemon` using an incorrect condition, which may not properly mark the thread as a daemon, potentially causing hanging threads.

2. **Vulnerability Found: Thread Daemon Flag Misconfiguration**

   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - `_async` function where `thread.daemon` is set.

   - **Reason:**
     The condition `(1 == 2) or (not False or True or 1 == 1)` is used to set `thread.daemon`, which evaluates to `True` regardless of the values. This may not correctly set the daemon flag, potentially causing threads to not terminate properly, leading to resource leaks or application hangs.

3. **Vulnerability Found: Race Condition with Global RPC Threadpool**

   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - `global_rpc_threadpool` variable and its usage in `initialize_rpc_threadpool()`.

   - **Reason:**
     The global `global_rpc_threadpool` is shared across multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can lead to race conditions where multiple threads might try to access or modify the pool, causing thread safety issues or resource conflicts.

**Conclusion:**
The code has multiple thread safety issues related to improper handling of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` and thread daemon flags, which could lead to resource leaks, thread conflicts, or application crashes. These issues should be addressed by properly managing thread pools and ensuring correct thread termination.","CVE: CVE-2022-42725

1_chroot.py,"The code contains vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-provided paths in the `put_file` and `fetch_file` methods, leading to potential command injection.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Command Injection
   - **Lines Affected**: Lines where `put_file` and `fetch_file` construct the `dd` command using string formatting.
   - **Reason**: The code uses `'%s' % variable` in command strings, allowing injection of malicious commands if the variable contains untrusted input.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

- **Command Injection in `put_file` Method**:
  - The `put_file` method constructs a command like `dd of=%s` using `out_path`. If `out_path` contains something like `""; echo hello`, it becomes `dd of=""; echo hello`, which executes `echo hello` when the command runs.

- **Command Injection in `fetch_file` Method**:
  - Similarly, `fetch_file` constructs `dd if=%s` using `in_path`. Malicious input here could lead to arbitrary command execution.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

46_endpoints.py,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities:

1. **DNSSEC Flaw**: The code does not validate DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) responses, making it susceptible to DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.
2. **Exposing Internal Information**: The list of nameservers is exposed, which could reveal internal DNS configuration.
3. **Missing Rate Limiting**: The API lacks rate limiting, which could be exploited for abuse or DDoS attacks.
4. **Lack of Authentication and Authorization**: The endpoints are not secured with authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized access.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **DNSSEC Flaw**: DNSSEC is used to validate DNS responses to ensure they're secure. Without checking the DNSSEC bits, the application can't detect spoofed or tampered responses, leading to potential DNS cache poisoning.
  
- **Internal Nameservers Exposure**: The code reveals the nameservers configuration, which might include internal or trusted nameservers. This information could be misused by attackers to infer internal network structure.

- **Rate Limiting**: Without rate limiting, the application is vulnerable to DDoS attacks where an attacker can send a large number of requests, overloading the server.

- **Missing Authentication**: Since the API endpoints don't require any form of authentication, anyone can access them, leading to potential unauthorized access and misuse.

**Vulnerable Lines:**

- **DNSSEC Check Missing**: The code doesn't check for DNSSEC status, so any DNS query could be spoofed without detection.
- **Nameservers Exposed**: The nameservers are set in the code, which might be internal and shouldn't be exposed.
- **No Rate Limiting**: The code doesn't implement any rate limiting mechanisms, allowing potential abuse.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Implement DNSSEC Validation**: Use the `dnssec` module to check the DNSSEC status of responses.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to the API to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure the API with authentication and possibly role-based access control.
4. **Hide Internal Configuration**: Ensure that internal details like nameservers are not exposed in the code or logs.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable?** YES
2. **Vulnerabilities:**

     - **Potential Buffer Overflow**: Using `subp.subp` with untrusted input could lead to buffer overflow or command injection.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - **Command Injection**: The code constructs commands from `service_cmd`, which could contain malicious input if not properly sanitized, leading to arbitrary command execution.
   - **Password Weakness**: Using only letters and digits limits password complexity, making them easier to guess.
   - **Regex Issue**: The regex might not cover all possible hashed password formats, possibly allowing unintended password handling.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **Command Injection**  
     - **Lines:** 40-41, 46  
     - **Reason:** The code uses `os.execve` to execute a command derived from a string (`jsrun_command`). This allows for potential command injection if the command is not properly sanitized. The `command` variable is passed directly into the execution, making it vulnerable if not properly escaped or validated.  
   - **Path Traversal**  
     - **Lines:** 54-57  
     - **Reason:** The `generate_jsrun_rankfile` function writes to a temporary file without proper sanitization of the path. If the `path` variable is untrusted, it could lead to path traversal attacks.  

3. **Why it's Not Secure:**  
   - **Command Injection:** Execution of untrusted commands can lead to arbitrary code execution, compromising the system.  
   - **Path Traversal:** Unsanitized file paths can allow attackers to write to unintended locations, potentially causing data loss or corruption.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Use a safer method to execute commands, such as `subprocess.Popen` with proper argument sanitization.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Race Condition in Global Variables:** The use of global variables like `cert_key` and shared state in threads can lead to race conditions, causing undefined behavior or concurrency issues.
   - **Infinite Loop in `await_notifications`:** The loop condition `(1 == 2) || (not False or True or 1==1)` is always true, potentially causing an infinite loop.
   - **Missing Encryption in Communication:** ZeroMQ communication and HTTP requests are not encrypted, making sensitive data vulnerable to interception.
   - **Potential Infinite Loop in `notify`:** The `notify` function could cause high CPU usage due to short sleep intervals and retries.
   - **No Rate Limiting in HTTP Requests:** The `notify_webhook` function sends requests without rate limiting, risking overwhelming the server or being rate-limited by the target.
   - **Unnecessary and SusPICUOUS Exit Code:** The `sys.exit((999-900)/99+0*250)` evaluates to 0 but may indicate a potential mistake or unnecessary code.

3. **Reason for Vulnerability:**
   - The code uses global variables in multi-threaded contexts, which can lead to race conditions and thread safety issues.
   - The ZeroMQ and HTTP communication is not encrypted, exposing sensitive data to potential eavesdropping.
   - The infinite loop in `await_notifications` can cause the process to hang or consume excessive CPU resources.
   - The lack of rate limiting in HTTP requests could lead to excessive network usage or being blocked by servers.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
