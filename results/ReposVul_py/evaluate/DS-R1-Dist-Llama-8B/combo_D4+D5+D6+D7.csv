A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

2. **Explanation**: The visit_Call method in the SafeEvalVisitor class does not perform any validation on the function being called.

   - **NO**

2. **Reason:**
   The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, or command injection. The functions primarily handle tensor operations and window functions without direct interaction with external untrusted inputs. The only potential area is the `get_window` function's handling of the `window` parameter, which could allow for function name injection, but this is more of a design flaw than a security vulnerability.

3. **Explanation:**
   - **Function Name Injection:** The `get_window` function accepts a `window` parameter that can be a string or tuple. While it validates against known window types, a malicious actor could theoretically inject a function name that maps to unintended operations. However, this is mitigated by the code's structure which only allows registered functions, preventing arbitrary code execution.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Some functions use user-provided inputs for parameters like `x`, `M_sym`, and others, but these are within controlled environments and do not expose the application to external risks.
   - **Tensor Operations:** The use of `paddle` library functions ensures that operations are contained within the application's scope, avoiding external vector injection risks.

92_parser.py,"1. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Type: Race Condition**
     - **Lines: 5 (self._global_flags[0])**
     - **Reason: The use of a class-level flag (self._global_flags[0]) without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions, allowing multiple requests to interfere with each other. This could cause data to be processed incorrectly or lead to potential security issues.**

2. **Vulnerability Explanation:**
   - The `received` method checks `self._global_flags[0]` to determine if processing is already underway. If not properly synchronized, concurrent requests might cause the parser to mishandle data, leading to potential security issues or incorrect behavior.

3. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Buffer Handling:** The use of `OverflowableBuffer` and `FixedStreamReceiver` could be a concern if not properly managed, potentially leading to memory issues or DoS.
   - **Header Parsing:** The regex for parsing the first line might not validate all possible cases, allowing malformed requests to be processed incorrectly.

**Conclusion:** The code has a race condition due to the shared flag, which can lead to potential security issues if not properly synchronized.","CVE: CVE-2019-16785
CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

138_models.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** NO  
   The code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities upon initial analysis. It uses secure methods for generating and validating keys, employs proper input handling, and follows best practices for URL generation and parameter passing. The only potential area of concern is the use of a long validity period for certain confirmation types, but this doesn't inherently pose a security risk unless coupled with other factors.

2. **Reasoning:**  
   - **Key Generation and Validation:** The `generate_key` function uses `secrets.token_bytes` and base32 encoding, which are secure methods. The `get_object_from_key` function validates the key length against 24 or 40 characters, which may not be a security issue but is more of a system constraint.  
   - **URL Generation:** The `confirmation_url` function uses `urljoin` with parameters derived from the request, which is safe as long as the parameters are properly sanitized.  
   - **Model Handling:** The `Confirmation` model uses GenericForeignKey, which is generally","CVE: CVE-2021-43791
CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register.

   - **Lines**: create_token_response method in TokenView class  
   - **Reason**: The code checks if the refresh token has expired by comparing the token's creation time plus the expiration seconds to the current time. However, the `now()` function returns the current time in the server's timezone, while the token's creation time might not be timezone-aware. This can cause incorrect expiration checks, potentially allowing expired tokens to be used or blocking valid ones.  

**Explanation**: The `now()` function without timezone information might lead to incorrect token expiration logic, affecting security by possibly invalidating tokens too early or not at all.","CVE: CVE-2020-10709
CVE Description: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower.

   - **SQL Injection Risk in `relay_from_id` Function**
     - **Lines:** 28-30
     - **Reason:** The function directly uses `relay_id` from the request without proper validation, which could allow SQL injection if `relay_id` is untrusted.
   
   - **SQL Injection Risk in `ApiKeyAuthentication` Class**
     - **Lines:** 76-77
     - **Reason:** Uses `get_from_cache` with user-provided `userid`, which could lead to SQL injection if `userid` is untrusted.
   
   - **SQL Injection Risk in `OrgAuthTokenAuthentication` Class**
     - **Lines:** 117-118
     - **Reason:** Uses `filter` with potentially untrusted `token_str`, leading to possible SQL injection.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - **Input Validation:** Ensure all user-provided inputs are properly sanitized before use in database queries.
   - **Parameter Validation:** Validate `relay_id`, `userid`, and `token_str` to ensure they come from trusted sources.
   - **Query Parameters:** Use parameterized queries or ORM methods that prevent SQL injection when interacting with the database.

**Answer:**
YES, the code is vulnerable. The vulnerabilities are due to potential SQL injection risks in the `relay_from_id`, `ApiKeyAuthentication`, and `OrgAuthTokenAuthentication` classes. These issues arise from using untrusted inputs directly in database queries without proper sanitization.","CVE: CVE-2023-39349

   - **Buffer Handling:** The `data_received` method accumulates data without resetting the buffer, risking improper parsing and potential overflows.
   - **Data Validation:** The code doesn't check if the incoming data matches the expected size, leading to potential overflows.
   - **Server Binding:** Binding to all interfaces when the port is 0 makes the server accessible from multiple IPs, increasing exposure.
   - **Authentication:** Absence of authentication allows any client to connect, posing a security risk.

   - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in Truncator Class**  
     - **Lines:** Truncator class, specifically the `_truncate_html` method.  
     - **Reason:** The method processes user input without proper HTML escaping, allowing potential HTML injection. This can lead to XSS attacks if untrusted data is included in the output.

2. **Other Potential Issues:**  
   - **Regex Handling:** The `smart_split` function uses a regex that might not properly escape user input, potentially leading to regex injection if not handled correctly.  
   - **Filename Sanitization:** The `get_valid_filename` function may not sufficiently sanitize all possible malicious characters, posing a risk of path traversal or directory traversal.","CVE: CVE-2023-43665

3. **Reason:** The code does not sanitize the input HTML before processing with XPath, making it vulnerable to XPath injection.","CVE: CVE-2022-31052
CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

   **Vulnerability Type:** Missing or Insecure Secret Key Handling  
   **Vulnerable Lines:**  
   - Line: `try: SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']`  
     **Reason:** The code attempts to retrieve the SECRET_KEY from environment variables but does not handle the case where it's missing. This can lead to potential security issues if the application is deployed without a properly set SECRET_KEY, as it might be accessible or lead to application compromise.  

2. **Other Considerations:**  
   - **Database Configuration:** The default database uses SQLite, which is not recommended for production environments. However, this is more of a best practice concern rather than a direct vulnerability.  
   - **Security Headers and Middlewares:** The application has proper security headers like X-Frame-Options and CSRF protection, which are good.  
   - **Static Files and Templates:** No obvious vulnerabilities in static file configuration or templates.  
   - **Third-party Apps:** Includes common third-party apps like social authentication and admin interfaces, which are generally secure when properly configured.  

3. **Why It's Not Vulnerable:**  
   The application does not exhibit obvious vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF issues in the provided code. The main issue is the potential lack of a properly set SECRET_KEY, which should be addressed by ensuring it's securely configured in production.","CVE: CVE-2019-25091

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

203_ChuanhuChatbot.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure API Key Exposure  
   **Vulnerable Lines**: The line where `my_api_key` is used as a string without proper handling.  
   **Reason**: The API key is exposed in the code, which could lead to unauthorized access if the code is shared or committed to version control. This is a major security risk as API keys can be stolen and used maliciously.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure State Handling  
   **Vulnerable Lines**: Multiple state variables like `my_api_key`, `MODELS`, `REPLY_LANGUAGES`, etc.  
   **Reason**: These states might expose sensitive configuration data if not properly handled. For example, the API key is stored in a variable that might be accessible in the frontend, potentially leading to XSS or CSRF issues.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure File Upload Handling  
   **Vulnerable Lines**: The file upload functionality for PDFs.  
   **Reason**: Without proper validation or sanitization, uploaded files could contain malicious content or expose sensitive information.

4. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure CSS/JavaScript Inclusion  
   **Vulnerable Lines**: The CSS file is loaded from an external file.  
   **Reason**: If the CSS file is compromised, it could inject malicious scripts or styles.

**Summary**: The code has multiple security issues, primarily due to the exposure of the API key and insecure state handling. Immediate action is needed to secure the API key and ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized.","CVE: CVE-2023-34094

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.
