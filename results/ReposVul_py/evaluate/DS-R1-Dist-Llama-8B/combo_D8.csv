CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

   - **Reason**: The code trims leading and trailing slashes from the collection URL but doesn't validate the base path, potentially allowing path traversal attacks. For example, if the URL is manipulated to point outside the intended directory, it could expose unintended resources.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Regex Injection  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 34-35 in `_read_from_sections` function  
   - **Reason**: The code uses `re.escape` on the user and collection URL, but the regex patterns in the config might not be properly restricted, allowing injection if not designed carefully.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Config File Permissions  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The config file handling in `_read_from_sections`  
   - **Reason**: If the config file is not secured, it could be modified by non-authorized users to grant unintended rights.

**Final Answer:**
The code is vulnerable. It has potential issues with path traversal and regex injection due to how it handles collection URLs and regex patterns. Additionally, the config file permissions might not be secure.","CVE: CVE-2015-8748

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

- **Path Traversal**: The `os.path.exists` check in `setup_logging` doesn't sanitize the input, allowing users to specify paths outside the intended directory.
- **Unicode Handling**: The `gettext` installation with `unicode=1` may cause issues with non-ASCII characters, possibly leading to exceptions or incorrect string handling.

**Recommendation**: Sanitize all user-controlled inputs, validate file paths, and ensure proper handling of `gettext` configuration to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2013-0270

88_repoemail.py,"The code does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities upon initial review. It uses proper Flask security decorators like `@internal_only` and `@require_repo_admin` to restrict access. The code also includes input validation and proper error handling with Flask's `abort` function. There's no evidence of SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the provided code snippets. The use of `with tf(db):` suggests a database transaction, which is a good practice for maintaining data consistency. The code also includes a feature flag with `@show_if(features.MAILING)`, which adds another layer of security by disabling the endpoint when the feature isn't enabled.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Security Decorators:** The endpoints use `@internal_only` and `@require_repo_admin` to ensure only authorized users can access the functionality.
2. **Input Validation:** The code checks if the record exists before proceeding with the request and handles missing or unauthorized access by aborting the request.
3. **Database Transactions:** The use of `with tf(db):` ensures that database operations are atomic, reducing the risk of partial updates.
4. **Feature Flagging:** The `@show_if(features.MAILING)` decorator ensures that the endpoint is only active if the MAILING feature is enabled, adding another layer of security.
5. **Error Handling:** The code properly handles cases where the record doesn't exist or is already confirmed, preventing unintended behaviors.

**Conclusion:** The code is secure as it employs multiple layers of security measures, including proper access control, input validation, and feature flagging.","CVE: CVE-2020-27831

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Header Injection or Misprocessing  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 35-37 in `parse_header` method

2. **Other Issues**:  
   - The code uses `urlparse.urlsplit` without proper validation, which could be a vector for URI-related issues if not handled correctly.  
   - The use of `tostr` on various parts might not handle all edge cases, potentially leading to improper data handling.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Sensitive Information Leakage
     - **Lines**: `get_response` method
     - **Reason**: The method does not properly handle responses that may contain sensitive data, such as HTML content or JSON, which could leak internal information.

2. **Explanation**:
   - The `get_response` method in `BaseHTTPQueryRunner` raises an error only when the HTTP status code is not 200. This means that any other status code (e.g., 404, 500) will still return the response body, potentially exposing internal server errors or sensitive data to the client. This can lead to information exposure and potential security issues if the response contains sensitive information.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Modify the `get_response` method to handle non-200 status codes appropriately, perhaps by returning a generic error message without exposing the actual server response. Additionally, ensure that any response parsing does not expose sensitive data.","CVE: CVE-2021-43780
CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

   - **Reason:** The `captcha.validate()` method does not check the origin of the request, allowing potential CSRF attacks by not verifying the origin of the request. This can be mitigated by adding the origin to the validation check.

2. **Vulnerability Type: Missing Secret Key for CAPTCHA**
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** `test_captcha_with_init_app_ok` test case.
   - **Reason:** The CAPTCHA initialization does not set a secret key, which is essential for secure token validation. This can lead to insecure CAPTCHA tokens.

CVE Description: flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

197_stage.py,"1. **Vulnerable Code Identified: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Information Exposure
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
     - Lines where `pending_user` is used in the `get_token` method and `send_email` method.
     - Line in `get_full_url` where `token.key` is exposed in the URL.
   - **Reason:** The code exposes sensitive information such as the user's email and token in URLs and identifiers, potentially leading to privacy issues and security risks.

2. **Explanation:**
   - **Exposure of User Information:** The `pending_user` object is used in the creation of the `identifier` for tokens and in email sending. If `pending_user` contains sensitive information like the user's email or username, this could lead to unintended disclosure.
   - **Exposure of Token Information:** The token key is included in the URL generated by `get_full_url`, which could allow unauthorized access or session hijacking if the URL is shared or accessed improperly.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Token Expiration and Validation:** Ensure tokens are validated properly and have a short expiration time to reduce the window of attack.
   - **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize or pseudonymize the `pending_user` data used in identifiers and email addresses to prevent exposure of PII.
   - **URL Security:** Use HTTPS and ensure that sensitive URLs are not exposed in a way that could be accessed by unauthorized users.","CVE: CVE-2023-39522
CVE Description: goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine if a username exists. Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions 2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

1. **Insecure Token Handling**: The Authorization header includes the Dremio token in plain text, which could be intercepted if the connection isn't secure (e.g., not using HTTPS). This violates security best practices for API tokens.

2. **Hardcoded Credentials in Example**: The connection_args_example uses 'admin' and 'password' as default credentials, which is insecure if exposed.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop in native_query**: The loop might not correctly handle all possible job states, potentially causing an infinite loop if the job doesn't reach 'COMPLETED'.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

- **Insecure Token Handling**: The token is included in the Authorization header without encryption. This is risky because if the data is intercepted, an attacker could impersonate the user.
  
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Using 'admin' and 'password' as defaults in the example configuration is insecure. These should be handled securely, perhaps through environment variables or secure storage.

- **Infinite Loop Risk**: The while loop in native_query might not correctly handle all possible states, leading to an infinite loop if the job doesn't update correctly. This could cause the application to hang or consume resources indefinitely.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Secure Token Handling**: Use HTTPS for all API communications to encrypt the token in transit.

2. **Secure Credentials Handling**: Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use environment variables or secure secret management practices.

3. **Improve Loop Handling**: Implement proper error handling or timeouts in the loop to prevent infinite waits.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable?** YES
