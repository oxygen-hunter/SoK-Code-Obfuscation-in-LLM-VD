CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   The code contains several potential security vulnerabilities and insecure practices.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
     - **Lines:** `OX5E7D3C4F` and others where user input is rendered without proper escaping.
     - **Reason:** User input is used directly in templates without sanitization, allowing XSS attacks.
   
   - **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration**  
     - **Lines:** `OX3C7E8D4F` and `OX6DFEA7F7` methods.
     - **Reason:** The CORS logic may allow unintended origins due to regex matching that doesn't cover all cases, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized domains.
   
   - **Path Traversal Vulnerability**  
     - **Lines:** `OX5E3D4B2C` class using `os.path` without sanitization.
     - **Reason:** Malicious paths could lead to reading unintended files or directories.
   
   - **SQL Injection Risk**  
     - **Lines:** `OX7D4B3C2F` method using `json.loads()` without proper sanitization.
     - **Reason:** Untrusted JSON data could be injected and potentially used in SQL contexts if improperly handled.
   
   - **Missing CSRF Protection**  
     - **Lines:** No visible CSRF token checks in forms or state-changing actions.
     - **Reason:** Without CSRF tokens, state-changing actions are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.

3. **Why it's Vulnerable:** The code lacks proper input validation and sanitization, allowing various vectors for exploitation. Some security headers are set, but they don't fully mitigate all potential threats. Additionally, the use of external libraries and frameworks (like Jinja2) requires careful configuration to prevent vulnerabilities.

4. **Not Sure About:** The extent of the SQL injection risk depends on how `json.loads()` is used elsewhere in the application. Without more context, it's unclear if it's directly interacting with a database.","CVE: CVE-2015-5607

   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Line 28: `OX6C5D4E3F.decode(OX7B8A9C0D[""id_token""], verify=False)`  
     - **Reason**: The code incorrectly uses the OAuth token (OX7A6B5C4D) instead of the client secret (OX7E6D5C4B) to decode the JWT. This allows an attacker who possesses the token to bypass the signature verification, leading to potential session hijacking or unauthorized access.  

2. **Other Considerations**:  
   - The application does not validate the CSRF token on incoming requests, relying solely on the state parameter, which may not be sufficient for all scenarios.  
   - The client secret is stored in memory and used correctly in some parts of the code, but its usage in the JWT decoding step is flawed.  
   - The application does not enforce HTTPS for the OAuth callback endpoint, which could","CVE: CVE-2014-125028

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

1. **Incorrect Method Call in Super()**: The method `OX1F2G3H4I` is used when calling `super()`, but the correct method in `TokenView` is typically `post`. This mismatch may cause the token refresh functionality to fail or not behave as expected.

2. **Lack of Token Validation**: The code doesn't validate the `refresh_token` length or format, potentially allowing invalid tokens to be processed.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Method Call**: Lines 12-13 in `OX9D0E1F2G` class.
- **Missing Token Validation**: Lines 14-15 in `OX9D0E1F2G` class.

**Reasoning:**
- The method name mismatch can lead to the token refresh not functioning correctly, causing potential 403 errors or token rejection.
- Without validating the token's format and length, attackers might exploit it, leading to security issues.","CVE: CVE-2020-10709
CVE Description: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Token Handling and Potential Naming Conflicts  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Multiple lines where custom authentication classes and functions are defined, particularly those handling tokens and authentication logic.  
   - **Reason**: The code defines several custom authentication classes (e.g., `OX7D9B3E1A`, `OX1C9B3D7E`, `OX7C9A1B2D`) that manipulate tokens and authentication headers. These classes use potentially insecure methods for token validation and may expose sensitive information. Additionally, the use of similar variable names to Django settings (e.g., `OX9A7D2B3F.DEBUG`) could lead to unintended side effects or conflicts if the settings are modified.  

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Token Validation  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where token validation is performed, such as in `OX7D9B3E1A.OX4E1D9B5C()` and `OX1C9B3D7E.OX4E1D9B5C()`.  
   - **Reason**: These methods validate tokens by checking the prefix and length but may not properly handle all edge cases, potentially allowing invalid tokens to be accepted.  

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Use of Anonymous User  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines returning `OX3F2A1D9C()` (AnonymousUser) in functions like `OX7C9A1B2D.OX6F2A9D3C()`.

4. **Temporary Verification Keys**: Storing temporary keys without protection increases the risk of misuse.
5. **Potential Initialization Issues**: The bot's startup and shutdown handling might lead to race conditions.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Insecure Cookie Storage**: The code stores Roblox cookies in `config.json`, which is read directly. This exposes sensitive data if the file is compromised.
2. **Missing Auth Checks**: Routes like `/v1/products` and `/v1/create_product` lack essential authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Without rate limits, endpoints like `/v1/verify_user` and `/v1/give_product` can be exploited to cause DoS or financial issues.
4. **Temporary Key Storage**: The verification key is stored in memory, which is safer but lacks long-term protection against key theft.
5. **Bot Initialization**: Using `run_task` might not handle server startup correctly, potentially causing issues during runtime.

**Recommendations:**

- **Secure Sensitive Data**: Use secure storage for Roblox cookies and API keys.
- **Implement Authentication**: Add proper auth mechanisms to all API routes.
- **Add Rate Limiters**: Control the number of requests per endpoint to prevent abuse.
- **Secure Temporary Keys**: Ensure temporary data is handled safely, possibly using secure in-memory storage with expiration.

This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.
