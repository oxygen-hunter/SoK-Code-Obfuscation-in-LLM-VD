   **Vulnerable Lines**:  
   - Lines where `make_command` is used without proper argument sanitization, such as in `fetch_new`, `switch`, `update`, and `resolve_revision` methods.  
   **Reason**: The code constructs shell commands using `make_command` and passes user-controlled or external data directly into command-line arguments without proper escaping. This allows potential command injection attacks if the data contains shell metacharacters or malicious strings.  

**Explanation**:  
The code uses `make_command` to create command-line arguments, but it doesn't sanitize these arguments. If any of the arguments contain characters like `;`, `&&`, `||`, `>`, `<`, or `""` (which have special meanings in shell commands), they can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands. For example, a malicious URL or revision argument could contain `;` to separate multiple commands, leading to unintended execution of code.

No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

   - **Command Injection**: In the `decompile` method, the code uses `os.system` to execute a command built from user input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code if `jadx` is replaced or modified.
   - **Predictable Path**: The `dependencies` method uses a hardcoded path for `jadx`, which could be exploited if the path is known.
   - **Untrusted Input Handling**: The `integrity` method uses `input()` without proper validation, which could lead to command injection if the input is untrusted.

2. **Reasoning**: The code constructs commands dynamically and uses hardcoded paths, making it vulnerable to command injection and predictable path attacks. Additionally, untrusted input handling could expose the system to malicious inputs.","CVE: CVE-2021-21386

27_basic_ldap.py,"The code has several security vulnerabilities and potential issues:

1. **Insecure LDAP Configuration Handling**: The code constructs the `userdn` using a format string without proper sanitization, which could allow injection of malicious data.
2. **Race Condition**: When creating a new user, there's a race condition if two requests try to create the same username simultaneously.
3. **Insecure Resource Handling**: The `ldap_result` and `resultID` aren't properly closed, leading to potential resource leaks.
4. **Insecure Debug Logging**: Setting `trace_level=2` might log sensitive information.
5. **Potential Data Exposure**: Sensitive data like `customers` and `scopes` are included in the token, which might expose them in logs or responses.
6. **Unsanitized Input**: The `login` variable is used without proper validation, risking injection in domain parsing.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure LDAP UserDN Construction**: Lines 18-20 and 24
  - **Reason**: Using a format string without sanitization allows injection of malicious data into the LDAP DN.
  
- **Race Condition When Creating Users**: Lines 34-35
  - **Reason**: If two requests create the same username simultaneously, the second could fail or overwrite the first.

- **LDAP Resource Leak**: Lines 28 and 32
  - **Reason**: Not closing `ldap_result` or `resultID` can cause resource leaks.

- **Insecure Debug Logging**: Line 28
  - **Reason**: Debug level logging might expose sensitive LDAP connection details.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure in Token**: Lines 63-64
  - **Reason**: Including `customers` and `scopes` in the token might expose sensitive information.

- **Unsanitized Input Handling**: Lines 14-15
  - **Reason**: Using `login.split('\\')` without validation can lead to parsing issues if the input contains malicious characters.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Sanitize Input**: Use functions like `str-sanitize` on `login` and `username` to prevent injection.
2. **Use Context Managers for LDAP Connections**: Wrap LDAP operations in `with` blocks to ensure connections are closed.
3. **Limit Debug Logging**: Reduce the debug level or ensure it doesn't log sensitive data.
4. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Tokens**: Refrain from including sensitive data in tokens unless necessary and ensure it's properly encrypted.
5. **Implement Race Condition Handling**: Use a transactional approach or locks to prevent simultaneous user creation.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

68_bindings.py,"The code provided is part of the Pulp bindings module, which is used to interact with a Pulp server. It imports various API classes and initializes them within a Bindings class. Here's a breakdown of the potential security considerations:

1. **Module Import Analysis**: The code imports multiple modules from the pulp.bindings package. While this is standard, it's important to ensure that each module is properly secured and that there are no known vulnerabilities in them.

2. **API Initialization**: The Bindings class initializes several API instances. Each API should be checked to ensure they are properly configured with security measures like authentication and authorization. If any API lacks these, it could expose internal functionality to unauthorized users.

3. **Exposure of Internal APIs**: Some of the imported APIs (e.g., ConsumerAPI, RepositoryAPI) might expose internal server state. These should be protected to prevent unauthorized access, especially if they are exposed to external systems or users.

4. **Known Vulnerabilities**: Without specific knowledge of Pulp's API implementations, it's challenging to identify known vulnerabilities. However, it's crucial to check for any recent security advisories or patches related to these modules.

5. **Security Configuration**: Ensure that all APIs are configured securely, using HTTPS and enforcing role-based access control. Misconfigurations could lead to security issues.

6. **Input Handling**: Check for proper input validation in each API to prevent injection attacks or Denial of Service issues.

**Conclusion**: While the code as written doesn't show obvious vulnerabilities, the extensive use of internal APIs and potential exposure without proper security measures could pose risks.

69_client.py,"The code is vulnerable.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure API Request
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `conn.get("""", headers).json()`
   - **Reason**: The empty path may lead to unintended API endpoints being accessed, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access if the server isn't properly configured to handle it.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Missing Request Authentication
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` methods in `PKIConnection` do not include authentication headers in the session.
   - **Reason**: Without proper authentication, the API requests might be made on behalf of the client without authorization, leading to potential security risks if the server isn't expecting them.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Potential Path Traversal
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` methods construct the `target_path` using the provided path without proper validation.
   - **Reason**: This could allow path traversal attacks if the path isn't sanitized, potentially exposing unintended resources or leading to directory traversal.

**Final Answer:**

The code is vulnerable. It has multiple issues:

1. **Insecure API Request**: Using an empty path in `get()` may expose unintended endpoints.
2. **Missing Authentication**: The session lacks necessary authentication headers, risking unauthorized access.
3. **Path Traversal Risk**: Potential lack of path validation in method calls.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

- **Insecure API Request**: The empty string in `get("""")` might access a default or sensitive endpoint, which could expose internal data or allow unauthorized access.
- **Missing Authentication**: Without authentication headers, the API requests might be made without proper authorization, leading to","CVE: CVE-2020-15720
CVE Description: In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.

70_core_tags.py,"1. **Is the code vulnerable?** NO.
2. **Why?** The code does not contain obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It uses proper escaping and sanitization in several places, such as `mark_safe` and `smart_str`. The code also uses Django's built-in security features like `Session` and `reverse` for URL generation, which are secure by default. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better security practices.

3. **Areas for improvement:**
   - **XSS in `display_messages` tag:** The `display_messages` tag could potentially allow XSS if the `msgs` variable contains untrusted data that isn't properly escaped. The current implementation uses `smart_str(m)` which is safe, but if `msgs` contains user-generated content, it should be sanitized before being passed to the template.
   - **Hardcoding in `admin_menu`:** The menu entries are hardcoded, which limits flexibility but isn't a security issue. However, if user-specific data is added here, it should be done carefully to avoid exposing sensitive information.
   - **Missing CSRF protection in forms:** While not directly visible in this code, forms using this template might need CSRF tokens to prevent CSRF attacks. Ensure all forms are using `csrf_token` and `csrf_exempt` where appropriate.

4. **Conclusion:** The code is secure but could benefit from additional input sanitization and CSRF protection in forms to further enhance security.","CVE: CVE-2023-5690

   - **SQL Injection Vulnerability in `list_quotas` Function**
     - **Lines 18-23:** The code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation without proper escaping, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.
     - **Reason:** Using string interpolation or concatenation can introduce vulnerabilities if the variables aren't properly sanitized. This is a common issue in SQL-heavy code.

2. **Other Issues:**
   - **Missing CSRF Token Name in `ensure_csrf_cookie` Decorator**
     - **Line 28:** The `ensure_csrf_cookie` decorator is used without specifying a CSRF token name, which might prevent the cookie from being properly set or recognized.
     - **Reason:** Without a token name, the CSRF protection might not function correctly, leading to potential security risks.

**Final Answer:**
1. **Vulnerable? YES**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **SQL Injection:** Lines 18-23 in `list_quotas` function. The code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, which can be exploited.
   - **Missing CSRF Token Name:** Line 28 in `identities` function. The `ensure_csrf_cookie` decorator lacks a specified token name.
3. **Reason for Vulnerability:**
   - The SQL injection risk arises from unsafe SQL string construction, allowing malicious input to manipulate the database queries.
   - The missing CSRF token name can cause the CSRF protection to fail, making the application vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.","CVE: CVE-2023-0406

   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:  
     - **Lines**: Missing CSRF token usage in forms or templates.  
     - **Reason**: The `csrf = CSRFProtect(app)` is initialized but not used, leaving potential CSRF attack vectors if forms are present.  

2. **Explanation**:  
   - **SQL Injection**: The `load_user` function retrieves a user by `user_id`, which could be manipulated to inject SQL commands if not properly sanitized. This could lead to unauthorized access or data retrieval.  
   - **CSRF**: Without using `csrf_token()` in forms or templates, the application is susceptible to CSRF attacks, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of users.  

3. **Mitigation**:  
   - **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to ensure `user_id` is safely sanitized.

74_main.py,"The code has several security vulnerabilities:

1. **Insecure JWT Verification**: The JWT token is not being verified, allowing potential tampering.
2. **Open Redirect Vulnerability**: The sign-out route may redirect to untrusted URLs.
3. **Lack of Input Validation**: The code doesn't sanitize inputs, risking injection attacks.
4. **Insecure Secret Key**: The secret key is weak, posing a potential brute-force risk.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Insecure JWT Verification**: The `jwt.decode(tokens[""id_token""], verify=False)` line disables signature verification, making the token insecure.
- **Open Redirect**: The `/sign-out` route redirects to an external URL without validating it, risking redirects to malicious sites.
- **Input Validation**: Missing checks on user inputs can allow injection attacks.
- **Weak Secret Key**: The secret key is easily guessable, increasing the risk of session hijacking.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Secure JWT Verification**: Use `jwt.decode(..., verify=True)` and ensure the public key is correctly obtained.
2. **Validate Redirect URLs**: Use Flask's `url_scheme` or a whitelist to prevent open redirects.
3. **Sanitize Inputs**: Use functions like `str.strip()`, `reject_bad Characters`, and `check_length` for inputs.
4. **Use a Strong Secret Key**: Replace with a more secure key, ideally using a random 256-bit value.

**Vulnerabilities List:**

1. **Insecure JWT Token Handling**

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.

   - **Reason:** The QR code view (DeviceQRCodeView) does not perform any authorization checks before generating the QR code. This allows any user to access the device's configuration URL, potentially exposing sensitive information without proper authentication or authorization.

2. **Explanation:** The QR code generation in DeviceQRCodeView could expose the device's configuration URL to unauthenticated users, leading to potential security risks such as unauthorized access to 2FA settings or device information.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **DeviceQRCodeView** is a Django view that generates a QR code for a user's 2FA device.
- The view does not include any checks to ensure the requesting user is authorized to view the device.
- This means that even if a user is not authenticated or authorized, they can access the QR code by navigating to the URL, leading to potential security issues.
- The QR code URL might provide information that could be misused, such as the device's secret key or configuration, which should only be accessible to the device owner.

**Fixes:**

- **Add Authorization Check:** Before generating the QR code, check if the current user is either the device owner or has the necessary permissions to view the device.
- **Use OtpRequiredMixin:** Ensure that the view is decorated with OtpRequiredMixin so that only authenticated and authorized users can access it.
- **Restrict Access:** Use the device's user attribute to verify that the requesting user is the owner or has permission to view the device.

**Example Fix in Code:**

```python
class DeviceQRCodeView(OtpRequiredMixin, View):
    if_configured = True

    def get(self, request):
        device = utils.get_unconfirmed_device(self.request.user)
        if not device.user == self.request.user or not self.request.user.has_perm(""user.change_user""):

In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service.

   - **Vulnerability Type**: URL Validation Missing
     - **Lines**: 29-31
     - **Reason**: The code does not validate the URL provided, which can lead to open redirect attacks or unintended query injection.
   - **Vulnerability Type**: HTTP Status Code Handling
     - **Lines**: 24-25
     - **Reason**: The code only checks for a 200 status code, potentially allowing other status codes to cause issues or expose sensitive information.

2. **Explanation**:
   - **URL Validation**: The `get_response` method uses the provided URL without validation, which can allow malicious URLs to be processed, leading to potential security risks like open redirect.
   - **HTTP Status Code Handling**: Only checking for 200 status codes might leave other status codes unhandled, which could result in errors or information exposure.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Implement URL validation to ensure only trusted URLs are processed.
   - Expand status code checks to handle all 4xx and 5xx statuses appropriately, providing meaningful error messages and handling them correctly.

The code is vulnerable due to missing URL validation and incomplete HTTP status code handling, which can expose the application to security risks.","CVE: CVE-2021-43780
CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

152_endpoints.py,"The code is vulnerable due to potential information leakage in error messages when handling invalid inputs. Specifically, the `valid_args` methods in both `LookupRecordType` and `ReverseLookup` classes may expose parts of user input in error responses, leading to information disclosure.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **LookupRecordType's `valid_args` method:**
   - If `domain` is invalid, it returns a message containing the input domain, e.g., `""message: 'example.com is not a valid domain name""`.
   - This exposes the original input to the client, potentially revealing sensitive or personal data.

2. **ReverseLookup's `valid_args` method:**
   - If `ip` is invalid, it returns a message including the input IP, e.g., `""message: '192.168.1.1 is not a valid ip address""`.
   - This also exposes the user's IP address, which could be sensitive.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Leakage:**
  - **Lines 14-15 in LookupRecordType:**
    ```python
    abort(400, message=""%s is not a valid domain name"" % domain)
    ```
    - **Issue:** The error message includes the original `domain` value, exposing it to the client.
  
  - **Lines 18-19 in ReverseLookup:**
    ```python
    abort(400, message=""%s is not a valid ip address"" % ip)
    ```
    - **Issue:** The error message includes the original `ip` value, exposing it to the client.

**Mitigation:**
- Sanitize the error messages to avoid including the original input values. Use generic messages instead.

**Conclusion:**

     - **Lines: start method**
     - **Reason: The use of `os.execv` with potentially untrusted input from `self.argv` could allow arbitrary command execution, leading to system compromise.**

2. **Explanation:**
   - **Insecure File Overwrite**: The `write_default_config` method writes the default config file without user confirmation if `self.answer_yes` is True. This can result in overwriting existing configurations without the user's knowledge, which is a security risk.
   
   - **Command Injection**: The `start` method uses `os.execv` to execute a subcommand based on `self.subcommand` and `self.argv`. If `self.argv` contains malicious input, it could execute unintended or malicious commands, posing a significant security threat.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **For Insecure File Overwrite**: Implement a double-check before overwriting, perhaps by always prompting the user or using a backup strategy.
   - **For Command Injection**: Sanitize the input to `self.argv` to prevent malicious commands from being executed. Consider using a safer method like `subprocess.Popen` with proper argument sanitization or escaping.","CVE: CVE-2022-39286

If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

All sensitive fields are marked as Secret, and the code avoids storing plaintext passwords.","CVE: CVE-2023-41885
CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

CVE Description: goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine if a username exists. Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions 2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

2. **Why?** The code implements secure session management practices. It uses HTTPS-compatible cookie settings, secure hashing, and proper session handling to prevent common vulnerabilities like session hijacking and fixation. The code checks for the presence of a secret key and handles missing keys by returning a null session, which prevents session fixation. It also uses secure cookie attributes like httponly, secure, and samesite to reduce cookie-related vulnerabilities. The session serialization is done using a secure method with a unique salt, ensuring data integrity.","CVE: CVE-2023-30861
CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
