CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

65_chef.py,"The code has security vulnerabilities related to command injection and potential resource leaks.

1. **Command Injection Vulnerability**: The `_exec_cmd` function constructs command strings from user-provided arguments and kwargs without proper sanitization, allowing potential command injection.

2. **Temporary File Leak**: The `_retrieve_logfile_name` function creates a temporary file on Windows but doesn't delete it, leading to a potential resource leak.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

- **Command Injection**: The `cmd_kwargs` in `_exec_cmd` is built by directly using `k` and `v` without escaping, allowing malicious input to be injected into the command line, leading to arbitrary command execution.
  
- **Temporary File Leak**: On Windows, the temporary file isn't deleted after use, which could cause issues with disk space or leave unnecessary files behind.

**Recommendations:**

- **Sanitize Input**: Use proper methods to sanitize command arguments to prevent command injection.
- **Clean Up Resources**: Ensure temporary files are deleted after use to prevent leaks.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable?** YES
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Command Injection**: Lines 40-43 in `_exec_cmd` function. The command string is built without sanitization, allowing command injection.
   - **Temporary File Leak**: Lines 24-25 in `_retrieve_logfile_name` function. The temporary file isn't deleted, leading to potential resource leaks.
3. **Reasons:**
   - **Command Injection**: Direct use of untrusted input can execute arbitrary commands.
   - **Temporary File Leak**: Undeleted temp files can cause resource issues or exposure.","CVE: CVE-2015-1839

     - **Reason:** The `cmd.run` function uses a dynamically constructed command string, which can lead to command injection if the input isn't properly sanitized.

3. **Why it's a Problem:**
   - **API Parameter Injection:** Malicious parameters can be passed to functions like `create` and `ls`, potentially altering the API requests to manipulate data or perform unintended operations.
   - **Command Injection:** The `install_agent` function can execute arbitrary commands if the `agent_key` or other parameters are controlled by an attacker, leading to system compromise.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - **Sanitize all user-provided parameters** in functions that interact with external APIs or system commands.

CVE Description: The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

",2.0,943.0,6.0,1.0654940605163574
101_colors.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Regex Pattern Case Sensitivity  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The regex pattern `HEX_RGB` is defined as `r'#[0-9a-f]{3}'`, which only matches lowercase hex characters.  
   - **Reason**: This can cause the function to fail to recognize valid hex color codes that use uppercase letters (e.g., `#FF0000`), potentially leading to incorrect color parsing or exceptions when processing user input.

2. **Explanation**:  
   The regex pattern for `HEX_RGB` is case-sensitive and only matches lowercase hex values. If a user supplies a hex color with uppercase letters, the regex will not match, and the function may return incorrect color values or fail to parse the input correctly. This can lead to display issues or unexpected behavior in applications using this function.","CVE: CVE-2021-21236
CVE Description: CairoSVG is a Python (pypi) package. CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo. In CairoSVG before version 2.5.1, there is a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

2. **Vulnerabilities Type**:  
   - **Insecure Permission Check**:  
     - **Lines**: Lines 28-35 in `auth_check` function.  
     - **Reason**: The function `auth_check` has a flaw in how it checks if the `signer` is the owner of the `did_ledger`. Specifically, when `did_ledger.verkey` is `None`, it incorrectly assumes that `signer` is the owner if `signer` is equal to `did_ledger`. This can lead to unauthorized operations if an attacker knows the `did` but not the `verkey` of another user.  
   - **Insecure Fixtures**:  
     - **Lines**: Fixtures like `provisioner_role` and `provisioner` might not properly enforce all necessary role checks, potentially allowing unintended permissions.  
     - **Reason**: The fixtures might not correctly handle all possible roles, leading to potential bypasses of security checks.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

- The test function `test_wrapper` uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize(""test_file"", [""dummy""])`, which runs the test with ""dummy"" as the test file.
- The `test_crashes` function expects `test_files` to be a list of crash files, but ""dummy"" isn't in that list.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

**Explanation**: The code lacks proper validation for the refresh token and grant type, which can result in security issues such as unauthorized token usage or incorrect error responses, potentially exposing sensitive information.","CVE: CVE-2020-10709
CVE Description: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.

   - **Type:** Input Validation Vulnerability
   - **Lines:** 1. In the `relay_from_id` function, the `relay_id` is directly used from the request without proper validation.
   - **Reason:** The `relay_id` is retrieved from the request and used to fetch a Relay object. If the `relay_id` is provided by an untrusted source, it could lead to unintended behavior or attacks.

2. **Vulnerable Code Identified:**
   - **Type:** Input Validation Vulnerability
   - **Lines:** 1. In the `authenticate_credentials` method of `RelayAuthentication`, the `request.body` is used without proper validation.
   - **Reason:** The code sets `request.relay` and `request.relay_request_data` directly from the unpacked data, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the request body, leading to potential injection attacks.

1. **Insecure Listening Behavior**: The server may listen on all interfaces if the hostname is set to '0.0.0.0' or an empty string, making it susceptible to attacks from any IP address.

2. **Infinite Task Loop in Shutdown**: The `_close_task_loop` method can cause the server to hang with a 10-second sleep, potentially leading to a denial of service.

3. **Potential Client Injection**: The `clients` list in `OPCUAProtocol` might allow untrusted elements to be added, which could lead to unauthorized access if not properly validated.

**Step-by-step Explanation**:

- **Insecure Listening**: In the `start` method, the server is created with the provided hostname and port. If the hostname is '0.0.0.0' or an empty string, the server binds to all network interfaces, which is insecure. This can be mitigated by ensuring the hostname is set to a specific IP or hostname.

- **Infinite Task Loop**: The `_close_task_loop` method uses `asyncio.sleep(10)` in a loop, which can prevent the server from closing properly. This can be fixed by removing the sleep or ensuring tasks are properly awaited without indefinite delays.

- **Client Injection**: The `clients` list in `OPCUAProtocol` adds instances to it upon connection. Without proper validation, this could allow malicious clients to be added, leading to potential injection attacks. This should be secured by ensuring only trusted clients are","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

   - **Type: Insecure Token Handling**

     - **Reason:** The code uses a user-provided token (hf_foken) to interact with HuggingFace. If this token is compromised, it could allow unauthorized access to private datasets. Additionally, the code clones a repository without validating the token's validity or the user's permissions, leading to potential security risks.
   
   - **Type: Potential SQL Injection**

     - **Reason:** The code writes user-provided data directly into CSV files without proper sanitization. This could allow injection of malicious data if the input contains untrusted sources, leading to potential SQL injection or data corruption.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The HuggingFace integration uses a user-provided token which might be insecure if not properly validated. This could expose private datasets if the token is compromised.
   - The code writes data to CSV files without sanitizing the input, which could allow injection of malicious content if the data sources are untrusted.
   - The use of global variables like csv_data and headers in the flag method might not be thread-safe, though this is less of a security concern in a single-threaded Gradio environment.","CVE: CVE-2022-24770
CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Inverted Logic in `is_email` Function**  
     - **Lines:** `def is_email(user_input):`  
     - **Reason:** The function incorrectly returns an error message even when an email is valid because the condition checks for `@` in the wrong order. It should check if `@` is present and return the error message only when it's not.
   - **Using `random.SystemRandom()` in `make_password`**  
     - **Lines:** `return recursive_password(length - 1, acc + random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits))`  
     - **Reason:** `random.SystemRandom()` is not cryptographically secure and should be replaced with a more secure method like `secrets.choice` from the `secrets` module.
   - **Dynamic Password Generation in Config**  
     - **Lines:** Various places where `make_password` is used as a default value (e.g., in MySQL, Modoboa, SpamAssassin sections)  
     - **Reason:** Using a function call as a default value can lead to unexpected behavior during configuration processing. It should be replaced with a static value or a proper configuration management approach.
   - **Password Composition in `make_password`**  
     - **Lines:** `return recursive_password(length - 1, acc + random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits))`  
     - **Reason:** The generated passwords lack special characters, which could reduce their security. They should include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

3. **Why the code is vulnerable:**  
   The code contains several issues that could lead to security problems, including incorrect logic in email validation, insecure password generation, and improper handling of default values in configuration.

It should only be accessible by the user, but before version 2.0.1, its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well. This issue was patched in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Parameter Types in Ecrecover Function
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `test_invalid_signature` function's `test_ecrecover` call.
   - **Reason**: The `v` parameter is declared as `uint8` instead of `bytes32`, which can cause the ecrecover function to incorrectly decode the signature, potentially leading to security issues like reentrancy or incorrect address resolution.

2. **Explanation**: The `test_ecrecover` function expects `v` and `r` to be `bytes32` types, as they are part of the signature. Using `uint8` for `v` can cause the function to misinterpret the data, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.
