2. Vulnerabilities detected:

   a. **Vulnerability Type**: Command Injection
      - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `subprocess.Popen` is used with `shell=True` and the command is constructed using string formatting.
      - **Reason**: The code constructs command strings using `%s` formatting, which can be vulnerable to command injection if any of the variables contain untrusted input. Additionally, using `shell=True` with a constructed command string can execute arbitrary commands if the input is not properly sanitized.

   b. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Use of `shell=True`
      - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `subprocess.Popen` is called with `shell=True` and the command is a string.
      - **Reason**: Using `shell=True` with a command string can lead to shell injection attacks if the command string is not properly sanitized. This is especially risky when the command includes user-controlled input.

   c. **Vulnerability Type**: Lack of Input Validation
      - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where user input is used directly in command construction without proper validation or escaping.
      - **Reason**: The code does not appear to validate or escape user-controlled inputs that are used in command strings, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

   d. **Vulnerability Type**: Hardcoded Temporary File Size
      - **Vulnerable Lines**: The use of `OX7B4DF339 = 65536` as a hardcoded block size in the `OX5B3D1C2A` method.
      - **Reason**: While not a security vulnerability per se, using a hardcoded value can lead to issues if the value is not appropriate for all environments or if it needs to be configurable.

3. **Explanation**:
   - The code uses `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` and constructs command strings using `%s` formatting, which can lead to command injection if any part of the command is derived from untrusted input.
   - The lack of input validation or escaping for variables used in command construction increases the risk of injection attacks.
   - The use of `shell=True` is generally discouraged for security reasons, as it can expose the application to shell injection vulnerabilities.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Avoid using `shell=True` when possible. Instead, pass the command as a list of arguments to prevent shell injection.
   - Use proper input validation and escaping for any user-controlled data that is included in command strings.
   - Consider using safer alternatives for executing commands, such as `subprocess.run` with `check=True` and without `shell=True`.
   - Review the use of hardcoded values and consider making them configurable if necessary.","CVE: CVE-2015-6240

        - Line where `subprocess.Popen` is called in `OX9A0B1C2` method with `shell=isinstance(OX3N4O5P6, basestring)`.

      - **Reason**: Using `subprocess` with `shell=True` can lead to **Shell Injection** vulnerabilities if the command arguments are not properly sanitized. In this code, the command is built using string formatting, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if any part of the input is user-controlled.

   b. **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where file operations are performed without proper validation or sanitization.

      - **Lines**: 
        - `OX5H6I7J8` method where `OX9S0T1U2` is read and written to a file.
        - `OX6L7M8N9` method where `OX9S0T1U2` is read from and `OX2V3W4X5` is written to.

      - **Reason**: If the file paths (`OX9S0T1U2` or `OX2V3W4X5`) are derived from user input without proper validation, it could lead to **Path Traversal** attacks, allowing an attacker to read or write files outside the intended directory.

3. **Summary of Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Shell Injection**: The use of `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` and dynamically constructed command strings can execute arbitrary commands if inputs are not properly sanitized.
   - **Path Traversal**: The file operations may allow attackers to access or modify files beyond the intended scope if the file paths are not validated.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Avoid using `shell=True` when possible. Instead, pass command arguments as a list to `subprocess.Popen` to prevent shell injection.

     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The script uses `os.listdir`, `os.lstat`, `os.makedirs`, and `shutil.copyfile` with user-provided paths without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `--download_path` option allows users to specify a directory, which could be exploited to traverse directories or write files outside the intended location.
     - **Reason:** If an attacker can control the `download_path`, they might use relative paths (e.g., `../../`) to access or modify files outside the intended directory, leading to unauthorized data access or file overwrites.

   - **Improper Input Validation:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The script does not sanitize or validate the input paths provided via command-line arguments.
     - **Reason:** Without proper validation, user-supplied paths can lead to unintended file operations, increasing the risk of directory traversal or file injection attacks.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - **Sanitize Input Paths:** Use `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.normpath` to normalize paths and prevent directory traversal.
   - **Validate Paths:** Ensure that the provided paths are within an allowed directory and do not contain relative path components that could escape the intended directory.

         OX5A6C9DEA.write(OX2B8F0D7A.encode())
     ```
     **Reason:**  
     The code uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=False`, which creates a temporary file that persists on the filesystem. If the content being written (`OX2B8F0D7A.encode()`) is untrusted or contains sensitive information, it could lead to a temporary file injection vulnerability. Additionally, the file is not properly cleaned up after use, which could expose sensitive data.

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Use of Fixed Nonce in CTR Mode (Lines 14-16 and 20-22):**
     - **Reason:** The code uses a fixed initial value of 0 for the counter in CTR mode. This can lead to nonce reuse if the same key is used multiple times, which is a security risk as it can allow attackers to perform certain types of attacks, such as replay attacks.

   - **Lack of Proper Key Validation (Lines 10 and 17):**
     - **Reason:** The code does not validate the length or strength of the encryption key. AES requires keys of specific lengths (128, 192, or 256 bits), and without proper validation, weak or incorrect keys could be used, leading to insecure encryption.

   - **Potential for Key Reuse (Lines 10 and 17):**
     - **Reason:** The code does not ensure that keys are unique across different encryption sessions. Reusing the same key without a unique nonce can compromise security.

   - **Exception Handling (Lines 3-4 and 11-12):**
     - **Reason:** The code only handles the ImportError exception. Other potential errors during encryption or decryption are not caught, which could lead to crashes or information leaks.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The code contains security vulnerabilities primarily due to the use of a fixed nonce in CTR mode and the lack of proper key validation and handling. These issues could lead to insecure encryption practices if the code is used in a production environment.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Use a cryptographically secure random nonce for each encryption session to prevent nonce reuse.
   - Implement key validation to ensure that the key length is appropriate for AES encryption.
   - Add comprehensive error handling to catch and securely manage exceptions during encryption and decryption processes.

1. **Command Injection Vulnerability**:
   - **Vulnerable Line**: `subprocess.Popen(""`which echo` %s"" % OX1A2B3C4D, shell=True, ...)`
   - **Reason**: The use of `shell=True` combined with user-controlled input (`OX1A2B3C4D`) can lead to command injection. Even though the input is sanitized, it's insufficient to prevent all possible injection vectors.

2. **Insecure Handling of Environment Variables**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `os.path.expandvars(OX1A2B3C4D)`
   - **Reason**: Expanding environment variables without proper validation can allow attackers to inject malicious commands or paths through environment variables.

3. **Path Traversal Vulnerability**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `os.chdir(OX5A6D7C8B['home_path'])`
   - **Reason**: If the `home_path` variable is manipulated by an attacker, it could lead to unauthorized access to restricted directories.

4. **Insufficient Input Sanitization**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Various regex substitutions in `OX9C3B2A7D` and `OX1D2C3B4A`.
   - **Reason**: The regex patterns used to sanitize input may not cover all possible malicious inputs, leaving gaps for injection attacks.

**Recommendations**:
- Avoid using `shell=True` when executing subprocesses.
- Use safer alternatives like `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and list arguments.
- Validate and sanitize all user-controlled inputs thoroughly before processing.
- Avoid expanding environment variables in contexts where untrusted data is involved.
- Implement strict path validation to prevent traversal attacks.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code.

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **CSRF Protection Disabled ( CWE-352 )**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line where `csrf_exempt` is used in the `dispatch` method.
     - **Reason:** Disabling CSRF protection without proper justification can expose the application to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, allowing attackers to execute unintended actions on behalf of authenticated users.

3. **Additional Concerns:**

   - **Authorization Handling:**
     - The `OX4E2C5A1B` method checks for valid basic auth, but the security of this depends on how credentials are managed and transmitted. If not handled securely, it could lead to unauthorized access.

   - **Data Validation:**
     - The `post` method processes incoming data without clear evidence of input sanitization or validation, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities.

   - **Regex Usage:**
     - The `OX9E8C7B5D` property uses regex, which could be vulnerable to regex injection if not properly escaped or if user input is involved.

   - **Response Handling:**
     - The use of `HttpResponse` might lead to XSS if dynamic content is generated without proper escaping.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The primary security vulnerability stems from the use of `csrf_exempt`, which disables CSRF protection. This increases the risk of CSRF attacks, especially if the view handles sensitive operations. Additionally, the code's handling of authorization, data processing, and regex usage could introduce other security risks if not properly secured.","CVE: CVE-2018-6596

   - **CSV Handling:** The CSV functions use `csv.Sniffer()` and `csv.DictReader`, which are safe for parsing CSV data. The custom dialects registered (`crlf` and `lf`) do not introduce vulnerabilities.
   
   - **File Operations:** Functions that read or write files use codecs and standard file handling, which are secure when used correctly. There's no evidence of path traversal or command injection in these operations.
   
   - **URL Handling:** The `urlopen` function is used to fetch data from URLs, but without additional context on how the URL is sourced, it's assumed to be used securely.
   
   - **No Code Execution:** There are no instances of `eval()`, `exec()`, or other functions that could execute arbitrary code, which are common sources of vulnerabilities.

77_serializers.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Type:** Insecure Deserialization
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines using `pickle` (e.g., `OX9A7B6C3B.dumps` and `OX9A7B6C3B.loads`)
     - **Reason:** The use of `pickle` for serialization and deserialization is inherently unsafe because it can execute arbitrary code upon deserialization, leading to potential remote code execution vulnerabilities.

   - **Type:** Potential Code Injection via Custom Hooks
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines in `OX5C6D7E8F` (json), `OX1B2C3D4E` (msgpack), and `OX2F3E4D5C` (cbor) where `default` and `object_hook` parameters are used.
     - **Reason:** If custom hooks are not properly sanitized or validated, they could be exploited to inject malicious code or manipulate data during serialization/deserialization.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The inclusion of `pickle` without any restrictions is a critical security flaw. It allows attackers to craft malicious data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code, leading to potential system compromise.
   - While `json`, `msgpack`, and `cbor` are generally safer, the use of custom hooks without proper validation introduces risks. These hooks could be exploited if not carefully managed.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Remove or disable the `pickle` serializer to eliminate the risk of insecure deserialization.
   - For other serializers, ensure that any custom hooks are thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent code injection or data manipulation.
   - Implement input validation and use safe modes (e.g., `simplejson` with `decode_tuples=False`) where possible.

     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines in `OX3D7A5B9` and `OX5F3B8A1` functions where files are extracted without proper path sanitization.
     - **Reason:** The code extracts files from archives without ensuring that the extracted paths are within the intended directory. This could allow an attacker to write files outside the target directory, leading to potential code execution or data corruption.

   - **Insecure File Upload Handling**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines in the POST route where file extensions are checked.
     - **Reason:** The code relies solely on file extensions to validate uploads, which can be bypassed. An attacker could upload a malicious file with a valid extension but containing harmful content.

   - **Potential Code Execution**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Extraction functions `OX3D7A5B9` and `OX5F3B8A1`.
     - **Reason:** If an attacker can upload a malicious archive, the extraction process might write executable files to the server, which could be executed if permissions are set incorrectly.

3. **Remediation Steps:**

   - Implement strict path sanitization when extracting files to prevent directory traversal.
   - Use secure file handling libraries that automatically handle path traversal.
   - Validate uploaded files beyond just the extension, perhaps using MIME type checks or content analysis.
   - Ensure that extracted files are placed in a secure, non-executable directory.

       - Specifically in functions like `OX5D1A6B4E`, `OX7E9C1B6D`, and `OX7E1B4A9D` where variables are concatenated into ebtables commands without proper sanitization.
     - **Reason:** The code constructs ebtables commands using user-provided input without proper escaping or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to potential system compromise, especially since commands are executed with `run_as_root=True`.

3. **Mitigation Recommendations:**
   - **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all user-provided inputs are properly escaped or validated before being used in command construction.
   - **Use Safe String Formatting:** Utilize methods that prevent command injection, such as using parameterized queries or built-in functions that handle escaping automatically.
   - **Least Privilege:** Avoid running commands with `run_as_root=True` unless absolutely necessary. Consider reducing privileges where possible.
   - **Validation Checks:** Implement checks to ensure that input values conform to expected formats (e.g., valid IP addresses, correct MAC addresses) before using them in commands.

   - **Buffer Overflow (OX8C93 function):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where `sock.recv(1024)` is used and data is accumulated.
     - **Reason:** The function reads data in chunks of 1024 bytes without checking if the total accumulated data exceeds a safe limit. While there's a check for `OX6A71` (512MB), if an attacker sends a large amount of data without the end marker, it could cause memory exhaustion.

   - **Infinite Loop Risk (OX8C93 function):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The `while True` loop.
     - **Reason:** If the end marker (`OX4E5F`) is never received, the loop will run indefinitely, leading to a denial of service.

   - **Improper Data Handling (OXI9J0 function):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The processing of received data without proper validation.
     - **Reason:** The function splits data using a delimiter but doesn't validate the integrity of the data, potentially leading to incomplete or malformed command processing.

   - **Command Injection Risk (OXQ5R6 class methods):**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Methods like `OXF5G6` and `OXH9I0` where data is appended and sent without proper sanitization.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

136__xml.py,"The code does not have any major security vulnerabilities because it properly configures the XML parser to prevent XXE attacks and network access.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Imports and Setup:**
   - The code imports necessary modules from `lxml.etree` for XML parsing.

2. **Custom XML Parser Class:**
   - The class `OX6F9B1D3E` inherits from `XMLParser`.
   - In the constructor, it disables entity resolution (`resolve_entities=False`) and network access (`no_network=True`), which mitigates XXE attacks and prevents fetching external resources.

3. **Parsing Function:**
   - The function `OX9C7A6B3D` uses the custom parser.
   - It sets `recover` based on the input parameter, which affects error handling but doesn't introduce security risks since other security settings are in place.

4. **Security Analysis:**
   - **XXE Prevention:** By disabling entity resolution, the parser doesn't process external entities, preventing potential data exposure or attacks.
   - **Network Access Prevention:** Disabling network access stops the parser from accessing external URLs, reducing the risk of resource theft or attacks.
   - **Error Recovery:** While `recover=True` might allow processing of malformed XML, it doesn't inherently pose a security risk when combined with the other secure settings.

**Conclusion:**
The code is configured securely against common XML parsing vulnerabilities, making it safe from XXE and network-based attacks.","CVE: CVE-2021-29421

1. **Use of SHA-1**: The code uses SHA-1 for generating signatures. While SHA-1 is considered insecure for certain applications, in this context, it may still be acceptable depending on the specific requirements. However, upgrading to SHA-256 would be more secure.

2. **XML Parsing**: The code uses `lxml.etree` with `resolve_entities=False`, which prevents XML entity expansion attacks. If `lxml` is not installed, it falls back to `xml.etree.cElementTree` or `ElementTree`. It's crucial to ensure these fallbacks also disable entity resolution to prevent XXE attacks.

3. **XML Response Construction**: The code constructs XML responses using CDATA sections, which is safe. However, it's essential to ensure that all user-provided data is properly escaped to prevent XML injection.

4. **Signature and Timestamp Checks**: The code includes checks for the signature, timestamp, and nonce, which help prevent replay attacks. The timestamp validation seems robust, but the time window should be appropriately set.

   - **Token Reuse Vulnerability ( CWE-327 )**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where the refresh token is checked and used without invalidating the old token.
     - **Reason:** The code does not invalidate the old refresh token after issuing a new one, allowing potential reuse of expired tokens.

   - **Information Disclosure ( CWE-209 )**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The error message returned when catching AccessDeniedError includes the exception message.
     - **Reason:** Exposing internal error messages can reveal sensitive information to attackers.

   - **Lack of Token Revocation Check**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** The code only checks the expiration time, not whether the token has been revoked.
     - **Reason:** Revoked tokens should be rejected regardless of their expiration status.

   - **Missing Rate Limiting**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** No rate limiting is implemented on the token endpoint.
     - **Reason:** Without rate limiting, the endpoint is susceptible to brute force attacks.

   - **Inadequate CAPTCHA Regeneration (Lines 35, 54, 73):**
     - The CAPTCHA value is reused across multiple requests without regeneration, increasing the risk of replay attacks.

   - **Lack of Rate Limiting:**
     - The tests do not include checks for rate limiting, which could allow automated brute force attacks on the CAPTCHA.

   - **No CAPTCHA Timeout:**
     - Without a timeout, an attacker could potentially reuse a CAPTCHA token indefinitely.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The weak secret key is a critical vulnerability as it undermines the security of sessions.
   - Inadequate CAPTCHA handling and lack of rate limiting increase the risk of automated attacks.
   - Session management issues could expose the application to session hijacking.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Use a strong, randomly generated secret key.
   - Implement CAPTCHA regeneration for each request.
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
   - Secure session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags.
   - Implement CAPTCHA timeouts to invalidate old tokens.","CVE: CVE-2022-24880
CVE Description: flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

Additionally, if the `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded elsewhere or not properly protected, it could be a vulnerability.

3. **Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
   - The code contains hardcoded email addresses which could expose sensitive information.
   - The database configuration uses an empty password, posing a significant security risk.
   - The `SECRET_KEY` retrieval mechanism may not be adequately secured, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Remove or securely manage hardcoded email addresses.
   - Ensure that the database password is set to a strong, unique value and not hardcoded.
   - Implement proper security measures for handling environment variables, especially for sensitive information like `SECRET_KEY`.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines where the token identifier is generated using `slugify(f""ak-email-stage-{OX6F2A4B7D.name}-{OX1E9B7D3C}"")`
     - **Reason:** The token identifier is based on predictable values (stage name and user), which could allow attackers to guess valid tokens, leading to unauthorized access.

   - **Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Email Spamming**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** `challenge_invalid()` method calls `OX4A7C1E9D()` which sends another email.
     - **Reason:** Without rate limiting, attackers could trigger multiple emails, overwhelming the email service or the user.

   - **Insufficient Token Revocation Mechanism**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Token expiration handling in `OX2B8A5C9E()`
     - **Reason:** While tokens expire, there's no mechanism to prevent reuse of expired tokens, potentially allowing attackers to use captured tokens after expiration.

3. **Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
   - The code lacks sufficient protection against token guessing, email spamming, and token reuse after expiration, posing security risks.

4. **Recommendations:**

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
