0_util.py,"1. **Vulnerability Identified**: The code has potential security vulnerabilities related to file system access and potential directory traversal.

2. **Vulnerable Lines and Reason**:
   - Lines 10-12 in `open_save_folder`: The use of `Gio.AppInfo.launch_default_for_uri` without proper sanitization of the URI can lead to directory traversal or denial of service attacks if the URI is malicious.
   - Line 20 in `verify_save_folder`: The `os.access` check doesn't verify if the path is a network share or mounted filesystem, which could expose sensitive data.
   - Line 30 in `have_free_space`: The `Gio.FileSystemInfo` query could be vulnerable to buffer overflow if not properly checked.
   - Line 40 in `relpath_from_uri`: The function could be used to construct malicious paths leading to directory traversal.
   - Line 50 in `print_stack`: Printing stack traces publicly could expose internal program state to attackers.

3. **Reason for Vulnerability**:
   - The code lacks proper input sanitization for file system operations, making it vulnerable to attacks that exploit untrusted file paths.
   - The `relpath_from_uri` function could be used to construct malicious relative paths, leading to directory traversal.
   - The logging mechanism doesn't filter sensitive information, potentially exposing internal program state.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Sanitize and validate URIs before using them in file system operations.
   - Use secure shell (SSH) or other secure methods for file transfers to prevent network-based attacks.
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all file system operations.
   - Restrict the use of `print_stack` to only internal use cases.
   - Use secure directory traversal prevention mechanisms in `relpath_from_uri`.
   - Implement logging controls to filter or restrict access to sensitive log levels or specific log messages.","CVE: CVE-2022-42725

2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Directory Traversal**: The code checks if the extracted file's directory starts with ""pfs-root"", but this check might not be sufficient if the PFS filesystem allows directory traversal through its file system structure. The check relies on the file's path relative to the original file, which might not prevent all possible traversal attempts.

The provided code is a GObject-based application that appears to handle file transfers between a sender and receiver. While the code seems to handle basic operations like starting, stopping, and canceling transfers, there are potential security vulnerabilities and improper error handling practices.

2. **Identified Vulnerabilities**

- **Unused Imports**: The code imports `ReceiveError` from `util` but does not use it anywhere in the code. This could lead to unnecessary memory usage or potential issues if the module is modified in the future.

- **Misuse of Fake Functions**: The `progress_report` method contains fake functions (`fake_function_does_nothing()` and `irrelevant_function()`) that are called regardless of the actual progress or error state. These functions bypass proper error handling and status updates, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior.

- **Potential Resource Leaks**: The `progress_report` method emits signals multiple times when it shouldn't, which could lead to unnecessary resource usage or even denial of service if misconfigured.

3. **Recommendations**

- **Remove Unused Import**: The `ReceiveError` import is unnecessary and should be removed to clean up the code and reduce potential issues.

- **Replace Fake Functions**: The fake functions should be replaced with proper error handling and status update mechanisms to ensure the application behaves correctly under all circumstances.

- **Optimize Signal Emissions**: Ensure that signals are emitted only when necessary to prevent unnecessary resource usage.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

The use of secure practices like proper exception handling for common HTTP errors, and the use of a secure web framework (Tornado) contribute to the overall security posture. The code appears to handle sensitive operations (like authentication) appropriately, and the use of Jinja2 templating with proper sanitization (not shown here) would further enhance security.

**Conclusion:** The code has two potential vulnerabilities related to deprecated module usage and improper exception handling. Addressing these could improve the overall security posture of the application.","CVE: CVE-2015-4707

46_endpoints.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Lack of secure DNS channel (e.g., HTTPS) around the resolver, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - No certificate pinning, allowing attackers to bind their certificates to the resolver's DNS zone.
   - No rate limiting, which could be exploited for denial of service attacks.
   - While the code has basic input validation, it doesn't secure the DNS resolution process, which is a critical security flaw.

The code lacks proper security measures around DNS resolution, which is a critical component of network security. Without securing the DNS channel, the resolver could be exploited to manipulate DNS queries for malicious purposes.","CVE: CVE-2015-10010

47_oauth_auth.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Improper Session Management:** The code uses `requests.get` to fetch user profile data and session data, which can lead to session fixation and potential CSRF attacks. The OAuth2Session should be used instead of making external HTTP calls.
   - **Redundant and Potential Attack Vector:** The `oauth_config` property checks if `self._junk_data_2` matches a specific string. If an attacker can manipulate `self._junk_data_2`, they could potentially control the OAuth configuration.
   - **Session Reset Risk:** The `flask_session[""next""]` cookie is set based on the request path. If the server crashes, any session data tied to this cookie could be lost.
   - **Exposure of OAuth2Session Instance:** The `oauth_session` property returns an `OAuth2Session` instance. If the instance is reused across requests, it might not reset properly, leading to incorrect authorization responses.

3. **Reason:** The code improperly uses `requests.get` to fetch user profile data and session data, which can lead to session fixation and potential CSRF attacks. It should use the `OAuth2Session` for these operations instead of making external HTTP calls. Additionally, the `oauth_config` property's redundancy and potential for misuse could be a vector for attacks.","CVE: CVE-2022-46151

48_tables.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. The code has the following vulnerabilities:
   - **Use of deprecated Django template filters**: The code uses `defaultfilters` which is deprecated since Django 2.0. This can lead to compatibility issues and potential security vulnerabilities.
   - **Potential XSS risk with `autoescape=True`**: The `filters.unordered_list` with `autoescape=True` allows unescaped form variables, increasing the risk of XSS attacks.
   - **Lack of CSRF protection**: The application does not have any CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
   - **Insecure metadata handling**: The `get_metadata` function uses `aggregate.metadata.iteritems()` without sanitization, potentially exposing sensitive data.

3. The reasons for the vulnerabilities:
   - Deprecated Django filters can cause issues with template rendering and are not supported in newer Django versions.
   - `autoescape=True` in `unordered_list` can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if form variables are not properly escaped.
   - Without CSRF protection, the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker can manipulate form submissions.
   - Handling of untrusted metadata can expose sensitive information, increasing the risk of data breaches.","CVE: CVE-2014-125070

2. **Vulnerability Details**:
   - **Type**: Formula Injection (CSRF)
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 12-20 (Export Resource Method)
   - **Reason**: The code attempts to prevent formula injection by stripping certain characters from the start of string values. However, this approach is insufficient because it only removes the first occurrence of these characters and does not handle cases where malicious characters might appear elsewhere in the string. This leaves a vulnerability where an attacker could still inject malicious formulas if the stripping is not thorough enough.

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The code defines `irrelevant_variable_b` but does not use it, which could lead to undefined variable warnings or errors.
   - The function `irrelevant_function_a()` always returns True, which might not be necessary and could be a point of confusion or potential misuse.
   - The stripping mechanism might not cover all possible cases of formula injection, making the code less secure than intended.

4. **Suggested Improvements**:
   - Enhance the stripping mechanism to remove all occurrences of malicious characters from the string values.
   - Consider using a more robust sanitization method, such as HTML escaping or using built-in functions to remove potentially dangerous characters from all parts of the string.
   - Review and update the use of variables and functions to ensure they are necessary and correctly implemented.","CVE: CVE-2022-2113

   - Lines in the `catch_insecure_warning` decorator where `always_false()` is called.
   - Lines in the `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` methods where `always_false()` is called.

3. **Reason**:
   - The `catch_insecure_warning` decorator ignores InsecureRequestWarning by ignoring it, which could allow an attacker to bypass SSL/TLS verification. Even though the dummy logs are triggered, the warnings are not being processed, making the code vulnerable to potential security breaches.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - The `always_false()` function should be removed or replaced with a reliable way to prevent dummy logs from bypassing the InsecureRequestWarning.
   - Ensure that the SSL/TLS context is properly configured to enforce SSL/TLS verification in the application.","CVE: CVE-2020-15720
CVE Description: In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.

   - **Issue 1**: Insecure secret key usage leading to CSRF exposure. The app uses a static secret key, which is insecure. It should generate a unique secret key per application instance.
   - **Issue 2**: Hardcoded secret in the authorize URL, making it easier to hijack sessions. The secret should be sent securely, not hardcoded.
   - **Issue 3**: Missing CSRF token in the response header, allowing replay attacks. The CSRF token should be included in the response headers, not just in the cookie.
   - **Issue 4**: Possible session initialization issues without proper checks. The code should check if the session exists before accessing it.
   - **Issue 5**: Running on localhost with debug mode, which is insecure. Debug mode should be disabled in production.

2. **Explanation of Vulnerabilities**
   - **Issue 1**: The app uses a static secret key, which is insecure and can be exploited by attackers.
   - **Issue 2**: The CLIENT_SECRET is hardcoded in the authorize URL, making it easier for attackers to hijack the session.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

   - **Vulnerable Lines:** The code makes HTTP requests but does not verify SSL/TLS certificates, exposing the connection to potential attacks.
   - **Reason:** Missing certificate verification leaves the communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and tampering.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The code uses `client.get_json` to fetch keys from a server but does not check if the server's SSL/TLS certificate is valid. This is a critical security flaw as it allows attackers to intercept or manipulate the communication.

3. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Implement SSL/TLS certificate verification using a trusted CA certificate store. This ensures that only requests from trusted servers are processed.

4. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Timing Attacks:** The use of `time.time()` in multiple places could potentially be manipulated, but without specific evidence, this is less critical.
   - **Cache Handling:** The caching mechanism in `_getKeysForServer` might cause issues if the server returns different keys, leading to authentication failures. Regular cache validation is needed.
   - **Request Handling:** Improving error handling for rejected requests could provide better debugging information and prevent silent failures.
   - **Performance:** The iteration over multiple signatures could be optimized for better performance.

   - The code contains a function `inconsequential_function` that is called but does not affect the functionality of the program. It is unnecessary and could be removed.
   - The `color` function processes color strings and looks them up in a dictionary `COLORS`. The keys in this dictionary are in lowercase, which means that color strings passed in uppercase will not be found.
   - The function uses regular expressions to parse color codes in different formats (RGBA, RGB, HEX). However, these regex patterns are case-sensitive, meaning that color codes with uppercase letters will not be matched.
   - The opacity parameter is handled differently depending on the color format, which could lead to incorrect values if not used properly.
   - The `negate_color` function assumes that the input to it is a valid RGBA tuple, but if the `color` function returns an invalid value, this could cause errors.

3. **Vulnerable Lines**:
   - Line 17: `fmt_re.sub(functools.partial(self.repl, target), message)`
   - Line 18: `repl(target: discord.Member, match: re.Match)`
4. **Reason**: The `repl` function is a static method, meaning it doesn't receive `self` when called. Using `functools.partial(self.repl, target)` incorrectly passes `target` as the first argument to a function that expects no `self` parameter, leading to an `AttributeError` when `self` isn't provided. This can allow command injection or other vulnerabilities if the replacement logic isn't properly handled.

The vulnerability arises because static methods in Python don't have a `self` parameter, and using `functools.partial` in this context incorrectly assumes that `self` is available, which it isn't in this case. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to replace text in messages, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate command execution.","CVE: CVE-2020-15172

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - **Dictionary-based lookups**: The code uses `get_sp_by` with a dictionary, which is insecure as it allows for key injection attacks. An attacker could bypass security by providing malicious keys.
   - **Heartbeat timeout handling**: The `heartbeat_timeout` is hardcoded to 10 seconds, which might not account for time zone differences or server clock issues, potentially causing SPs to be incorrectly marked offline.
   - **Lack of input validation**: The code does not validate incoming SPs before processing, leading to potential undefined behavior or remote code execution if data is manipulated.
   - **Print statements for logging**: While not a direct security vulnerability, print statements are not secure for production logging and should be replaced with logging libraries to prevent sensitive information exposure.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

   - **Reason:** The code uses the `requests` library without properly securing the headers and does not verify SSL/TLS certificates, making it vulnerable to XSS and other network-based attacks.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The `requests` library is a security risk as it can be used to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
   - The headers are passed directly without any sanitization, which could be used to carry malicious code.
   - The code does not set `verify_ssl=False` or disable SSL verification, allowing attackers to intercept SSL/TLS handshakes.

   - Replace the `requests` library with a more secure HTTP client library like `aiohttp` for asynchronous requests.
   - Use secure headers and ensure they are properly sanitized.
   - Verify SSL/TLS certificates to prevent certificate pinning and other related attacks.
   - Implement proper exception handling and logging to detect and mitigate potential attacks.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

163_revocation_notifier.py,"1. **Analysis of the code:**
   - The code appears to be a revocation notifier system that starts a broker process, handles notifications via IPC, and can also send notifications via a webhook.
   - The code uses the `requests` library for sending HTTP requests, which is a security concern as it could be vulnerable to various attacks if not properly secured.

2. **Security Vulnerabilities Identified:**
   - **Insecure HTTP Webhook Communication:**
     - The `notify_webhook` function uses the `requests` library to send HTTP POST requests without any authentication or encryption. This is a security risk as it allows potential attackers to intercept and tamper with the requests if the webhook is exposed.
     - **Reason:** Using HTTP over the wire without secure authentication can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering.
     - **Suggestion:** The code should use HTTPS for the webhook communication or include proper authentication mechanisms like certificates or tokens to secure the requests.

3. **Other Potential Issues:**
   - **Inadequate Error Handling:**
     - The code does not handle exceptions properly in the `requests` library. If the request fails, it logs a debug message but does not take any action to recover or mitigate the issue, which could lead to silent failures.
     - **Reason:** Insecure network communication can lead to data loss or tampering, which is a critical security concern.
     - **Suggestion:** Implement proper error handling and logging for the `requests` library to ensure that any issues are caught and reported at an appropriate level.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code has a security vulnerability in its use of the `requests` library for HTTP communication without proper security measures. This could allow for potential attacks such as data tampering or unauthorized access if the webhook is exposed.
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the HTTP requests with HTTPS or implement additional security measures like certificates or tokens to secure the communication channel.

**Final Answer:**
The code has a security vulnerability due to the use of HTTP communication without proper security measures. It should be updated to use HTTPS or additional authentication to secure the webhook communication.","CVE: CVE-2022-23950

This can expose sensitive user information, such as permissions and access levels, which could be used for unauthorized access or CSRF attacks.
   - **Reason:** Accessing user object access sets without proper restrictions can lead to exposing sensitive data, increasing the risk of exploitation.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Issue:** The `random_variable` in DomainViewSet is set to 10, which is a high threshold. If this variable is supposed to control access, it might be too lenient, potentially bypassing necessary security checks.
   - **Reason:** A high threshold could allow access to data it shouldn't, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive information.

3. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Issue:** The `get_queryset` methods in several viewsets (e.g., DomainViewSet, AliasViewSet, SenderAddressViewSet) use `objectaccess_set` without proper filtering or restrictions. This can expose user data and potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
   - **Reason:** Without additional security measures, these fetches can lead to exposure of user-specific data, increasing security risks.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The `read_from_format_instruction` method uses `struct.unpack`, which can be dangerous if the format string or input data is controlled by an attacker. Similarly, `write_from_format_instruction` uses `struct.pack`, which can be exploited if the data being written is not validated.
   - The lack of proper input validation means that an attacker could potentially cause unexpected behavior or execute arbitrary code if they can control the input to these functions.

3. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Replace `struct.unpack` and `struct.pack` with safer alternatives that provide input validation.
   - Use libraries or frameworks that handle data serialization and deserialization with proper security measures in place.

CVE Description: flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

   The code has potential security vulnerabilities related to error handling and exception reporting. Specifically, the function `space_to_batch_direct` raises exceptions when invalid inputs are provided, but these exceptions do not provide detailed error messages. This makes it difficult for developers to understand the cause of the error and take corrective action. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs thoroughly, which could lead to incorrect transformations or unexpected behavior if the inputs are manipulated adversarially.

2. **Vulnerabilities Type, Vulnerable Lines, and Reason**  
   - **Error Handling**: The function raises exceptions for invalid inputs but does not provide detailed error messages.  
     - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 19-21 in `space_to_batch_direct` where exceptions are raised.  
     - **Reason**: The lack of detailed error messages makes it difficult to diagnose issues, increasing the risk of exploitation or runtime errors.  
   - **Input Validation**: The function does not perform thorough validation of the `block_shape` and `paddings` parameters.  
     - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 10-12 where `block_shape` and `paddings` are converted to numpy arrays without validation.  
     - **Reason**: Adversarial inputs could cause incorrect transformations or overflow issues.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

- **Issue with password generation logic in `generate` method:**
  - The check for `uppercase and lowercase` is broken because the condition `42 + 58 != 100` is always true, allowing both to be True, which the code then rejects. This is insecure as it doesn't prevent the generation of passwords with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  
- **Insecure password strength checking:**
  - The use of SHA-1 hashing for password strength checks is outdated and insecure. SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks, making it unsuitable for password strength verification.
  
- **Incorrect condition in `quickgenerate` method:**
  - The condition `bulk * 2 != bulk + bulk` is always false, so the code incorrectly allows the generation of the same password multiple times when `save` is True and `bulk > 1`. This is insecure as it doesn't generate unique passwords for bulk saves.
  
- **Lack of password validation:**
  - The code doesn't check for empty passwords or passwords that are too weak (e.g., consisting only of numbers or symbols), which could lead to weak password generation.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

   - **Type:** External Call to Internal Function
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** In the `test_init_calls_internal` function, the `__init__` function calls `self.bar(a)`, where `bar` is an internal function.
   - **Reason:** Allowing external functions to call internal functions can lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities, as internal functions are not intended to be called from outside the contract.

2. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The code does not include checks or sanitization for inputs, which could be a vector for injection attacks if not properly handled.
   - **Integer Range Handling:** The test expects a compile failure for `n=256`, but since `uint256` can handle values up to 255, the test might be incorrect in expecting a failure for 256.
   - **Arithmetic Operations:** The functions `bar` and `baz` perform arithmetic operations that could lead to unexpected results if inputs are not properly bounded or validated.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

   - **Error Handling:** The code does not properly handle connection failures, leaving the connection open in case of errors.
   - **SQL Injection Risk:** The `native_query()` method could be vulnerable to SQL injection if the SQL string is not sanitized.
   - **Resource Leaks:** The connection is not always properly closed, especially if the server goes down or the connection is re-established.
   - **Inefficient Error Handling:** The code does not adequately handle response errors from the native query, leading to potential data loss.
