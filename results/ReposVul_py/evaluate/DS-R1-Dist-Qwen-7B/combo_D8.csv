CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

   - **Reason:** The regex patterns use `^` and `$` which can cause partial matches, allowing unintended access. This could lead to unauthorized access if the patterns match unintended collection paths.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The regex patterns for collections in the code use `^` and `$` to anchor the matches. This can cause the regex to match only at the start or end of the string, potentially allowing partial matches that should only match exact paths.
   - For example, a regex pattern like `collection:.*` might match any string starting with ""collection:"", which could allow unintended matches if the collection URL is not properly anchored.

3. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Modify the regex patterns for collection URLs to use more precise anchoring, such as matching the entire string or using more specific patterns that account for possible variations in the collection URL.
   - Ensure that the regex patterns are designed to match only the intended collection paths and not partial matches that could lead to unauthorized access.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - **Type:** Potential Security Breakthrough (PoS)
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Multiple places where configuration is accessed or where external services are connected.
   - **Reason:** The code has several points of potential attack, including direct configuration access, unverified connections to external services like Elasticsearch, and lack of proper input validation.

2. **Explanation:**
   - **Unverified External Connections:** The code connects to Elasticsearch without proper validation of the URL's domain or certificate. This could allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack if the URL is misconfigured.
   - **Configuration Vulnerability:** The code uses `current_app.config` to access configuration settings. If an attacker can gain access to this configuration, they could potentially overwrite sensitive settings or misconfigure services.
   - **Hardcoded Strings:** The `create_plugin_dir` function writes hardcoded strings to `setup.py` and `__init__.py` files. This is insecure as it allows attackers to overwrite plugin functionality without proper validation.
   - **Directory Naming:** The plugin directory name is generated using `name.replace(""archivy_"", """")`, which could result in invalid directory names if the `name` contains invalid characters.
   - **File Permissions:** The code uses `os.makedirs` without checking if the directory already exists, which could lead to permission issues if the directory is not writable by the process.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Secure Configuration Handling:** Use a configuration management tool like `YAML` or `Tombola` to securely store and manage configurations. Never write configuration settings to userland files.
   - **Secure External Service Connections:** Always validate the domain and certificate of external services before connecting. Use secure protocols like HTTPS and TLS.
   - **Input Validation:** Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized before being used in configuration files or service URLs.
   - **Valid Directory Naming:** Use a consistent and predictable naming convention for directories and files. Avoid using special characters that could cause issues with the filesystem.
   - **Error Handling:** Improve error handling in critical sections of the code to prevent crashes and ensure that errors are properly logged and handled.

2. The vulnerabilities identified are:
   - **Weak hashing methods**: The code uses MD5 (via `apr_md5_crypt`), which is insecure and easily crackable. This is a major security risk as it allows attackers to brute-force passwords more effectively.
   - **Timing attack risk**: The `is_authenticated` method includes a loop with a random sleep, which could potentially leak timing information, allowing attackers to guess passwords faster.

   - **Command Injection**: The `_exec_cmd` function constructs a command string by joining `args` and `kwargs`. If any of these arguments are untrusted or come from user input, they could be used to execute arbitrary commands. For example, if an attacker can provide a malicious argument, they could potentially run any command they desire.
   - **Background Execution**: The code runs Chef in a non-POSIX environment by default, which allows it to execute as a background process. This makes it harder for the system to stop the process if an attack occurs.
   - **Temporary Directory Handling**: The `_dynamic_logfile_name` function creates log files in a temporary directory. However, it does not check if the directory exists before creating the file, which could lead to race conditions where another process deletes the directory, causing the log file to be inaccessible.

3. **Reason**: The code is vulnerable to command injection and background execution vulnerabilities. The command string is constructed without proper input sanitization, allowing malicious arguments to be injected. Additionally, the code runs Chef in a non-POSIX environment by default, making it harder to stop the process if an attack occurs.

   - In Python, assigning a function to a variable does not execute it. Therefore, `self.actions` remains a function reference, not an API instance.
   - When the code later tries to use `self.actions`, it will throw an `AttributeError` because the attribute doesn't exist.
   - Proper initialization is crucial for the API instances to function correctly, and failing to call the functions results in broken or non-functional code.

3. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Modify each assignment to call the function, e.g., `self.actions = createActionsAPI()()`.
   - This ensures that each API instance is properly created and available for use in the class methods.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code is vulnerable due to improper initialization of API instances, which can lead to runtime errors and potential security issues when the code is executed.","CVE: CVE-2015-5263

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - The code suppresses InsecureRequestWarning, which is a security warning that should be addressed by updating the code to use a more secure method, such as using a custom root CA or removing SSL verification if it's not needed.
   - The SSL context might still be using a trusted CA even when the verify flag is set to False, because the verify flag in the SSL context isn't being properly set based on the session's verify flag.
   - The session's verify flag is not being explicitly set in the methods, which could lead to inconsistent behavior.

   - **Hook Injection**: The use of hooks like `before_bulk_action` and `after_bulk_action` could be a point of injection if not properly controlled. However, in this context, they're used for testing, so it might not be a direct vulnerability.
   - **URL Construction**: The `get_url` function uses `reverse` with app and model names. If these names are not properly sanitized, they could be used to create malicious URLs.
   - **Testing Without Proper Sanitization**: Hardcoded usernames and emails in tests could be a risk if they're not properly escaped, potentially leading to XSS attacks.
   - **User Permissions Handling**: The test checks if a user can't delete themselves, but if the user's permissions are not correctly enforced, this could allow unintended deletions.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

93_tests.py,"1. **Yes**, the code has security vulnerabilities.

2. **Vulnerabilities and their reasons:**
   - **Inadequate User Agent Validation:** The code uses outdated user agent strings (e.g., 'Python/2.7') in testing, which could be vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
   - **Lack of Session Validation:** The session validation in tests does not strictly check user agent and IP, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
   - **Insufficient Session Handling:** The session store may not properly handle or validate session data, leading to potential attacks.

3. **If you are not sure, the reason is the potential for user agent spoofing and session data exposure due to weak validation.**

---

**Suggested Fixes:**

1. **Update User Agent Detection:**
   - Use a modern method to detect user agents, such as checking for `HTTP_USER_AGENT` in requests.
   - Example: Add a decorator to check user agent strings before allowing access to sensitive areas.

2. **Implement Proper Session Validation:**
   - Strictly validate user agents and ips in session lookups.
   - Example: Modify the `MiddlewareTest` and `ViewsTest` to include checks on `HTTP_USER_AGENT` and `REMOTE_ADDR`.

3. **Add CSRF Protection:**
   - Use Django's built-in CSRF middleware to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
   - Example: Add `@csrf_exempt` decorator to middleware functions.

4. **Enhance Session Handling:**
   - Ensure sessions are properly invalidated and cleaned up.
   - Example: Regularly delete expired sessions and ensure session data is not exposed in logs.

By implementing these fixes, the code will be more secure against potential attacks.","CVE: CVE-2020-5224

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

95_constants.py,"The code contains several potential security vulnerabilities related to configuration handling, system information access, and default value management. Here's a structured analysis and recommendations:

### Vulnerabilities Analysis

1. **Configuration Handling Risks**
   - **Issue**: The code uses `ConfigParser`, which is a legacy module and can be a vector for injection attacks. Additionally, it retrieves configuration values that might be untrusted, potentially allowing unauthorized access or code injection.
   - **Recommendation**: Replace `ConfigParser` with a more secure configuration management library, such as `python-configparser` or a modern alternative like `python-dotconfig`.

2. **Sensitive Information Handling**
   - **Issue**: The code accesses sensitive system information like the active user and configuration file paths without proper authentication. This could allow unauthorized access to system resources.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before accessing or storing sensitive information.

3. **Insecure Default Values**
   - **Issue**: Default values for sensitive settings (e.g., passwords, SSH keys) are set to `None`, making them easier to guess or brute-force. Additionally, default values for sudo and remote access might be too permissive.
   - **Recommendation**: Use stronger default values or enforce more secure password policies. Consider using hashed or encrypted defaults where possible.

4. **Environment Variable Handling**
   - **Issue**: The code retrieves environment variables using `os.getenv()`, which can be unsafe if the variable's value","CVE: CVE-2014-4678

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Key Injection (Exploitation of improper key parsing)
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 15-16 in `add_public_key()`
   - **Reason**: The code does not properly validate the integrity of the public key string, allowing potential injection of malicious keys that could bypass subsequent checks.

2. **Vulnerable**
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Restrictive Key Format Check
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 20-21 in `add_public_key()`
   - **Reason**: The check for newlines in the public key string is unnecessary and restrictive, as valid SSH keys can contain newlines.

3. **Vulnerable**
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Exception Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 35-36 in `add_public_key()`
   - **Reason**: Using 'DuplicateKey' exception instead of 'KeyNotFound' when a key already exists is incorrect, as 'KeyNotFound' is more appropriate for missing keys.

4. **Vulnerable**
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Lack of User Validation
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 25-26 in `add_public_key()`
   - **Reason**: The code does not validate the existence of the user before attempting to add the public key, which could allow unauthorized users to add keys.

   - **Reason:** The code does not validate the contents of uploaded files, allowing potential injection of malicious files (e.g., ZIP or TAR archives) that could unpack into harmful code or execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, there is no Content Security Policy (CSP) or Content-Type header filtering, which could allow untrusted content to be processed.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Lack of File Size Control**
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** All file upload routes (`/languages`, `/languages/upload`).
   - **Reason:** The code does not restrict the size of uploaded files, which could lead to memory exhaustion attacks or denial of service if an attacker uploads excessively large files.

3. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Missing Rate Limiting**
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** All upload routes (`/languages`, `/languages/upload`).
   - **Reason:** The code does not implement rate limiting, which could allow multiple clients to overwhelm the server simultaneously.

4. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Inadequate Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Exception handling in `_unpack_uploaded_zipfile` and `_unpack_uploaded_tarball` functions.
   - **Reason:** The code catches some exceptions but does not log them or provide detailed error messages. Additionally, there is no logging of sensitive operations (e.g., unpacking of files), which could be useful for detecting and mitigating security incidents.

**Suggestions for Mitigation:**
- Implement file validation and content security policies (CSP) to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.
- Add file size limits and rate limiting to protect against attacks.
- Enhance error handling by logging exceptions and providing detailed error messages.
- Add logging of sensitive operations to aid in security monitoring and incident response.
- Sanitize and validate locale names and file paths to prevent unexpected behavior or injection attacks.
- Consider using a third-party library for secure file handling and internationalization to mitigate known security risks.","CVE: CVE-2022-3607

In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue.

2. **Vulnerability Details**:
   - **Type**: Path Injection (File Execution)
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where testsubject_path is used and passed to the sydent.sydent command.
   - **Reason**: If testsubject_path is user-controlled or not properly sanitized, it could be used to inject malicious files or execute shellcode when the sydent process runs.

3. **Explanation**:
   - The code writes configuration files to testsubject_path, which if not controlled by the code, could be exploited to execute malicious commands.
   - The sydent process could potentially execute shellcode if it gains access to testsubject_path, especially if it's run with insufficient privileges.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Sanitize all user-controlled inputs to prevent path injection.
   - Ensure that testsubject_path is checked for malicious content before use.
   - Restrict the permissions of testsubject_path and the sydent process to prevent unauthorized access.

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Expired Refresh Token Check, Token Validation, Outdated URI Construction
   - **Reason**: The code does not properly validate the refresh token's expiration and integrity. The expiration check uses a default timeout that may be too short, and the token validation lacks proper checks. Additionally, the absolute URI construction method is outdated and may not handle all edge cases.

2. **Reason**: The REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS setting defaults to 0, causing tokens to expire immediately. This can lead to frequent token refreshes and potential token hoarding. The token validation does not check the token's integrity, allowing potential misuse. The absolute URI construction method is outdated and may not handle all edge cases, increasing the risk of injection or manipulation.

      ```sql
      if is_public == 1:
          is_shelf_name_unique = ub.session.query(ub.Shelf) \

   - **Security Headers Missing:** The code does not include any security headers (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) which are essential for protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access.
   - **Command Injection Risk:** The use of `shutil.which` poses a risk of command injection if an attacker can execute a malicious executable through this method.
   - **Untrusted File Operations:** The code performs file operations without proper input validation or sanitization, increasing the risk of path traversal or directory enumeration attacks.
   - **Insecure Logging:** The code logs all events to the default logger, which could be exploited to gather sensitive information or disrupt logging processes.
   - **Insecure Configuration Handling:** The `write_default_config` method allows for uncontrolled file writes, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes.
   - **Vulnerable Subcommand Discovery:** The `_find_subcommand` method uses `which` to discover subcommands, which could be exploited to run malicious code if the PATH includes malicious executables.

2. **Recommendations:**

   - **Implement Security Headers:** Add necessary security headers based on the application's requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) to ensure compliance and data protection.
   - **Sanitize Inputs:** Use `os.path.join` with sanitized paths and implement proper input validation to prevent path traversal or directory enumeration attacks.
   - **Secure Logging Practices:** Configure logging to only include relevant information and use secure logging libraries to prevent misuse of logs for malicious activities.
   - **Restrict File Operations:** Limit file and directory operations to predefined paths and use permissions checks to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive areas.
   - **Secure Subcommand Discovery:** Replace `which` with a more secure method for discovering subcommands, such as using `subprocess` modules or leveraging environment variables, to mitigate command injection risks.
   - **Input Validation:** Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized before being used in file operations or command execution to prevent malicious use.

   - **Reason:** The code uses `cPickle` for pickling and unpickling objects, which can lead to command injection and code execution attacks if misused. Additionally, the socket handling lacks proper validation and error checking, increasing the risk of remote code execution.

2. **Detailed Vulnerabilities:**
   - **C pickle (cPickle):** The use of `cPickle.dumps` and `cPickle.loads` can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. For example, if an attacker can manipulate the data passed to `write_to_file_descriptor`, they could cause the system to execute malicious code when the pickled data is unpickled.
   - **Socket Handling:** The `send` method connects to a socket without proper validation of its existence or security. This could allow unauthorized access to the socket.

CVE Description: Dispatch is an open source security incident management tool. The server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message when the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin encounters an error when attempting to decode a JWT token. Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs. If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file. This issue has been addressed in commit `b1942a4319` which has been included in the `20230817` release. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

180_setup.py,"1. **Vulnerability Analysis:**

   - **Path Handling Issues:**
     - The code uses `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` which can be dangerous if the inserted path includes malicious directories. It should use `os.path.abspath` to ensure the path is correct and validate paths before insertion.
     - The `os.path.dirname(__file__)` is used to get the project root. If this is misused, it could lead to unintended directory traversal. It should be validated to ensure it points to the correct location.

   - **Module Imports:**
     - Modules like `versioneer`, `setuptools`, and others are imported with `# noqa` warnings. This can hide potential vulnerabilities. It should be ensured that these modules are from trusted sources and not modified.

   - **File Copying:**
     - The `shutil.copy2` function is used for file copying, which is secure, but the source paths should be validated to prevent directory traversal or injection.

   - **Missing Sanitization:**
     - The code does not perform input validation or sanitization, which could lead to injection attacks if user-provided data is used without proper checks.

2. **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Use absolute paths for directory manipulation to prevent path traversal.
   - Validate all paths before insertion into `sys.path`.
   - Ensure that all module imports come from trusted sources and remove unnecessary `# noqa` warnings.
   - Add sanitization and validation for user inputs and file paths to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:** The code has potential vulnerabilities related to path handling, module imports, and missing sanitization. These can be mitigated by using absolute paths, validating imports, and adding sanitization checks.","CVE: CVE-2022-2822

   - **Potential SQL Injection Risk:** The `get_user_filter` function may be susceptible to SQL injection if it uses raw SQL queries.
   - **Exposure of Model Fields:** The `verify2facode` form uses a UserKwargModelFormMixin, which exposes the model's fields, increasing the risk of exploitation.

2. **Explanation:**
   - **CSRF Vulnerability:** Without CSRF tokens, attackers can exploit these forms to perform unauthorized actions, such as account creation or password changes.
   - **SQL Injection Risk:** The `get_user_filter` function could be a vector for SQL injection if it queries the database with untrusted data.
   - **Model Form Risks:** Using a UserKwargModelFormMixin allows attackers to manipulate the form's model fields, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - **Implement CSRF Protection:** Add CSRF tokens to all forms to prevent CSRF attacks.
   - **Use Django's Filtering Methods:** Replace the custom `get_user_filter` with Django's built-in `filter` method to avoid potential SQL injection risks.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

     - `email = self.executor.plan.context.get(get_dynamic_email_override(), None)`
     - `email = pending_user.email`
     - `message = TemplateEmailMessage(...)`
   - **Reason**: 
     - The code retrieves sensitive information (e.g., `pending_user.email`) from untrusted sources without proper sanitization.
     - The `send_mails` function could be exposed to XSS if the `template_name` or `template_context` includes untrusted data.
     - The `get_dynamic_email_override()` function returns a static string, which might not prevent potential infinite loops or unexpected behavior.
3. **Explanation**: 
   - The code improperly uses `self.executor.plan.context`, which is a security risk as it can be manipulated by attackers.
   - Exposing `pending_user.email` directly is a security flaw as it allows unauthorized access to user email addresses.
   - The `send_email` method could be a vector for XSS attacks if the email templates are not properly sanitized.
   - The `get_dynamic_email_sent()` function returns static strings, which might not prevent potential issues like infinite loops or unexpected behavior in the email verification process.","CVE: CVE-2023-39522

Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions 2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

   - **Issue:** The `open_session` method does not check if the session cookie is prefixed with `Secure`. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by setting a session cookie without going through the proper session initialization.
   - **Reason:** Without the `Secure` prefix, the session cookie can be intercepted and used to impersonate the user, leading to potential unauthorized access.
   - **Suggestion:** Modify the `open_session` method to check if the session cookie starts with `Secure` before proceeding with session initialization.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Issue:** The `save_session` method does not handle cases where the session cookie might already be present in the response. This can lead to session hijacking if an attacker sends a valid session cookie without initiating the session.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

1. **Potential Lack of Input Validation for API Key**
   - **Issue**: The code hides the API key input field when `multi_api_key` is enabled, which might be a security risk. Users might not be aware that they need to input their API key, and if the key is not properly validated, it could be exposed.
   - **Suggestion**: Ensure that the API key is always displayed and validated, regardless of the `multi_api_key` setting. This prevents users from bypassing API key requirements unknowingly.

2. **Insufficient Input Masking for User Information**
   - **Issue**: The `user_name` state variable is directly exposed and stored. If this information is compromised, it could be used maliciously.
