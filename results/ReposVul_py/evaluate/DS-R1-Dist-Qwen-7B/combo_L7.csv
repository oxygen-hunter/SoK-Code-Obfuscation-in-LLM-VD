CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Insufficient LDAP Security:** The code uses the standard Python `ldap` module, which is not secure by default. It lacks proper configuration for secure LDAP connections, such as specifying TLS certificates, cipher suites, and other security parameters. This could lead to vulnerabilities like remote code execution or information disclosure.
   - **Weak Configuration Handling:** The code retrieves configuration settings from `current_app.config`, which is a security risk. Configuration data should not be exposed in the application context like this. It could be vulnerable to injection or manipulation.
   - **Insecure Email Handling:** The code uses `sys.stdout.encoding` when decoding emails, which could be a security risk if the email contains malicious bytes or non-UTF-8 characters.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code splits the username and password using both '\' and '@' symbols, which could potentially bypass domain checks if the username doesn't contain a domain. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented.
   - **Exposure of Configuration Data:** The code fetches domains and groups from `current_app.config`, which is a security risk. Configuration data should be stored in a more secure manner, such as in environment variables or a secret manager.
   - **Limited Exception Handling:** The code has broad exception handling but could benefit from more specific security-related exceptions and better error messages to help with debugging and risk mitigation.
   - **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The use of `current_app.config` could expose sensitive configuration data if not properly secured, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
   - **Insufficient Error Handling:** The code catches general exceptions but not specific security-related exceptions. Specific error handling for security issues could improve risk management.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - **Reason:** The code does not properly validate the `USE_L10N` setting before applying sanitization and localization. Additionally, there are potential issues with how `default` is handled in `sanitize_separators`.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The `sanitize_separators` function assumes that `USE_L10N` is enabled without checking, which could lead to incorrect sanitization when `USE_L10N` is not set.
   - The `get_format` function does not validate the `use_l10n` parameter correctly, which could bypass necessary sanitization and localization steps.
   - The use of `force_str` on `default` in `sanitize_separators` could cause issues if `default` is `None`, leading to unexpected behavior.

3. **Suggested Fixes:**
   - Add validation to ensure `USE_L10N` is enabled before applying sanitization.
   - Properly handle cases where `default` is `None` in `sanitize_separators`.
   - Validate the `use_l10n` parameter in `get_format` to ensure it is correctly set and handled.

   The code has multiple security vulnerabilities related to untrusted file operations, command injection, and improper handling of user input.

2. **Detailed Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Untrusted File Operations**:  
     The `_fork` function uses `urllib.request.urlopen` to execute arbitrary commands if the URL is manipulated. This could lead to shell injection or remote code execution.  
     The `_edit` function uses `os.fork`, which can create child processes with different user privileges, increasing the risk of shell injection.  
     The `cmd_remote` function splits arguments using `shlex.split`, which could be used for command injection if not properly controlled.  
   - **Command Injection**:  
     The `_fork` function constructs command lines without proper input validation, making it a vector for command injection.  
     The `cmd_set` function uses `eval`, which can execute arbitrary code if the input is malicious.  
   - **Insufficient Sanitization**:  
     User inputs are not properly sanitized, leaving the code vulnerable to injection attacks. For example, the `cmd_remote` function does not validate the arguments before executing them.

3. **Suggestions for Fixes**:  
   - **Sanitize Inputs**:  
     Sanitize all user inputs using `shlex.quote` or `urllib.parse.quote` to prevent injection.  
     Restrict the evaluation of untrusted input to known safe functions.  
   - **Use Secure File Operations**:  
     Use `os.path.expanduser` and `os.path.join` to handle file paths safely.  
     Avoid using `os.fork` and consider using `subprocess` for executing commands.  
   - **Proper Argument Validation**:  
     Validate and sanitize arguments before executing them to prevent command injection.  
     Use `subprocess.check_output` with error checking to handle command execution safely.

   - **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Vulnerability:** The code uses a CSRF token (state cookie) but does not validate it properly on the client side. The `state` parameter in `sign_in_callback` is retrieved using `request.args.get('state')`, which does not automatically send an empty string if the parameter is missing. This could allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection by providing a malicious `state` value.
   - **Weak Secret Key:** The Flask app uses a static secret key `'someverysecretkey'` which is predictable and easy to guess. This key is used for signing requests and should be generated randomly.
   - **Exposure of Client Secret:** The `CLIENT_SECRET` is read from the environment and used in OAuth requests. If the secret is compromised, it could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

   - Use secure logging methods instead of console.log.
   - Validate and sanitize sensitive inputs before logging.
   - Consider encrypting sensitive information before logging.
   - Restrict logging to only necessary information and secure environments.

In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Soft Fork Check in Solidity Contract
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The code uses a soft fork check in the Solidity contract to verify the existence of a public key. Specifically, the requirement check in the `getPublicKey` function (`bytes(userKeys[userId].publicKey).length != 0`) is a soft fork condition that bypasses traditional key existence checks.
   - **Reason**: This soft fork check can be exploited by modifying the length of the public key bytes without changing the actual key, leading to bypassing the KeyNotFound check. This makes the system vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can alter the public key's length without detection, effectively bypassing security measures.
3. **Explanation**: The soft fork check is a non-standard way to validate the existence of a public key. It does not follow traditional cryptographic key existence checks and can be exploited by tampering with the public key's length, leading to potential key compromise or bypass of security checks.","CVE: CVE-2022-4768

101_colors.py,"After analyzing the code, here's the security assessment:

1. **Potential for Buffer Overflow or Invalid RGB Values**
   - **Issue**: The `color` function uses `sscanf` with the `%f` format specifier when parsing hexadecimal color values. This is incorrect because `%f` is meant for floating-point numbers, not hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values should be parsed using `%x` or `%X` format specifiers.
   - **Explanation**: Using `%f` for hex parsing can lead to undefined behavior, incorrect RGB values, and potential buffer overflows.
   - **Suggestion**: Replace `sscanf` with a hexadecimal-specific parser to correctly handle RGB values.

2. **Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Issue**: The `color` function does not validate the input string format or check for malformed RGB values after parsing.
   - **Explanation**: Without proper validation, the function may process invalid color strings, leading to incorrect RGB values or undefined behavior.
   - **Suggestion**: Add input validation to ensure the input string is in a correct format and RGB values are within valid ranges (0-255 for RGB components, 0-1 for alpha).

3. **Incorrect Negation of RGB Values**
   - **Issue**: The `negate_color` function simply subtracts each RGB component from 1, which is correct for inverting colors. However, it does not validate the input RGB values.
   - **Explanation**: If the input RGB values are outside the 0-1 range (for alpha) or 0-255 (for RGB components), negating them could result in invalid values that may cause rendering issues.
   - **Suggestion**: Before negating, validate that the input RGB values are within acceptable ranges.

112_views.py,"1. **Vulnerability Analysis:**

   - **Potential SQL Injection in RouterAjax:** The `RouterAjax` class constructs and executes a SQL query directly using Python's `cursor.execute()`. This approach is highly insecure as it allows for potential SQL injection if the inputs are not properly sanitized or prepared.
   
   - **Lack of HTTPS in GET Requests:** The code makes GET requests to external services (e.g., `https://secure.niceridemn.org/data2/bikeStations.xml`) but does not specify whether these requests are made over HTTPS. If the URLs are public, they could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
   
   - **Potential XSS in GeoJsonAjax:** The `GeoJsonAjax` class constructs a JSON response by concatenating strings. If the input data (`json`) contains untrusted data, it could be used to inject malicious code into the response.
   
   - **Insecure Handling of External Requests:** The `NiceRideAjax` class makes a GET request to an external service and processes the response. This approach is less secure than using Django's built-in request handling, which provides better input validation and CSRF protection.

2. **Recommendations:**

   - **Prevent SQL Injection:** The `RouterAjax` class should use prepared statements for all database queries to prevent SQL injection. This can be done using Django's `%i` placeholders or similar mechanisms.
   
   - **Use HTTPS:** Ensure that all external GET requests are made over HTTPS to prevent XSS attacks. This can be done by modifying the URLs to include `https://` instead of `http://`.
   
   - **Secure JSON Handling:** The `GeoJsonAjax` class should validate and sanitize the input data before constructing the JSON response to prevent XSS attacks.
   
   - **Use Django's Request Handling:** The `NiceRideAjax` class should handle the request within Django to take advantage of built-in security features like CSRF protection and input validation.

3. **Conclusion:**

   The code has several security vulnerabilities, particularly related to SQL injection and insecure handling of external requests. These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by implementing secure coding practices and leveraging Django's built-in security features.","CVE: CVE-2015-10060

119_test_nym_auth_rules.py,"1. **Code Vulnerability Analysis:**

   The code contains potential security vulnerabilities related to role-based access control and signature validation.

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Insufficient Role Validation in `auth_check` Function:**
     - **Issue:** The `auth_check` function may not correctly validate the roles for certain operations, particularly when the `op_role` differs from the `did_ledger`'s role. For example, when demoting a node, the function might not properly enforce the required roles, leading to unauthorized access.
     - **Impact:** This could allow unauthorized nodes to perform operations they shouldn't, potentially compromising the system's integrity and confidentiality.

   - **Missing Verification of 'verkey' in Edit Operation:**
     - **Issue:** In the `edit_op`, if the 'verkey' is not present, the code does not properly validate the signature. This could allow any node to sign the request without the required verification, bypassing security checks.
     - **Impact:** This could enable unauthorized signers to modify the ledger, leading to data tampering and potential security breaches.

3. **Recommendations:**

   - **Enhance Role Validation:**
     - **Action:** Modify the `auth_check` function to correctly validate roles for all operations, ensuring that only authorized nodes can perform specific actions.
     - **Details:** Specifically, ensure that when `op_role` differs from `did_ledger`'s role, the function enforces the appropriate role checks to prevent unauthorized access.

   - **Implement Signature Verification for 'verkey' in Edit Operations:**
     - **Action:** Update the `edit_op` validation logic to include checks for the 'verkey' when present. Ensure that the signature is verified against the correct private key to prevent unauthorized signers.
     - **Details:** Add a check in the `edit_op` processing that verifies the 'verkey' if it exists, ensuring that only the authorized node can sign the request.

4. **Conclusion:**

   The code has identified vulnerabilities in role-based access control and signature validation. By enhancing the `auth_check` function and implementing proper signature verification for edit operations, the security of the system can be significantly improved.","CVE: CVE-2020-11093
CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

   - **Potential Issues Identified:**
     - **Unused Function:** The `_c_func` function defines a C function using ctypes but does not utilize it, potentially leading to a memory leak.
     - **Server Initialization:** The `BinaryServer` class does not validate the port number or check if the server is already running, which could cause unexpected behavior.
     - **Cleanup Task Handling:** The `_close_task_loop` method runs indefinitely without proper task scheduling, which might leave tasks hanging if the server is stopped.
     - **Asynchronous Task Management:** The `_close_tasks` method uses a while loop to process tasks, which might not handle concurrent task executions efficiently.
     - **Resource Leaks:** The `_parse_data` method might not properly handle all exceptions, leading to potential resource leaks.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - **Add Error Handling:** Implement proper exception handling in the `_parse_data` method to ensure all errors are caught and logged appropriately.
   - **Validate Server State:** Add checks in the `BinaryServer` constructor to ensure the server is not already running and the port is valid.
   - **Refactor Cleanup Tasks:** Use asyncio tasks more effectively to ensure all cleanup tasks are properly scheduled and executed.
   - **Use Context Managers:** Consider using `asyncio.gather` or context managers for better task management and resource cleanup.
   - **Remove Unused Code:** Remove or properly handle the unused `_c_func` function to prevent potential memory leaks.

   - **Reason:** The `recv` function is typically used for reading data from a socket, not for sending. Using it for sending data can lead to unexpected behavior, such as data loss or corruption, as it's not designed to handle the write operations.

3. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Type:** Potential Race Condition in Socket Operations
   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - `uint64_t data_len = data.size();`
     - `uint64_t len_net = htobe64(data_len);`
     - `if (send(sock, &len_net, sizeof(len_net), 0) != sizeof(len_net)) {`
     - `close(sock);`
     - `throw ConnectionError(""Failed to send data length"");`
     - `}`
     - `if (send(sock, data.c_str(), data_len, 0) != data_len) {`
     - `close(sock);`
     - `throw ConnectionError(""Failed to send data"");`
     - `}`
   - **Reason:** The socket operations are not properly synchronized. The code sends the length and data sequentially, but if the recv call does not block, the data might not be properly received, leading to data loss or corruption. This could result in incomplete or corrupted data being processed.

**Summary:** The code has multiple security vulnerabilities, including potential untrusted module execution, incorrect use of socket functions, and a possible race condition in socket operations. These issues could lead to unauthorized access, data interception, or data corruption.","CVE: CVE-2021-3620

2. **Vulnerable Lines**: The code includes `flask.h`, `jinja2.h`, `werkzeug/serving.h`, and `blueprints.h`. The `blueprints.h` is particularly concerning as it enables dynamic route configuration.
3. **Reason**: The use of Flask Blueprints allows for the dynamic addition of routes, which can be exploited to inject malicious code into the application. This is a major security risk as it can lead to remote code execution.

The code is vulnerable because it leverages Flask Blueprints, which can be exploited to inject arbitrary code into the application. Additionally, the static initialization of the Flask app without proper input validation makes it a target for potential XSS or CSRF attacks.","CVE: CVE-2023-0055

192_forms.py,"1. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Issue:** Typographical Error in Imports and Method Parameters
   - **Details:** The `ProfileForm` class has several issues related to incorrect module imports and method parameters.
     - The import statement for `auth_forms` is incorrect. It should be `from django.contrib.auth import forms as auth_forms` instead of `from django.contrib.auth import (forms as auth_forms, get_user_model, password_validation)`.
     - The `clean_oldpassword` method has a typo in the parameter name: `param_tools.get_global_parameter(""authentication_type"")` should be `auth.get_global_parameter(""authentication_type"")`.
     - The `save` method incorrectly uses `self.cleaned_data[""confirmation""]` instead of `self.cleaned_data[""newpassword""]` to set the password.

2. **Vulnerability Identified:**
   - **Issue:** Incorrect Password Validation
   - **Details:** The `clean` method calls `password_validation.validate_password(confirmation, self.instance)`, which is not the correct way to validate passwords in Django. Instead, password validation should be handled by Django's built-in `validate_password` method or the `formset`'s validation logic.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

   - **Email Handling:**
     - **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The code retrieves and uses the user's email address (`pending_user.email`) without encryption. This is a critical security flaw as it exposes sensitive user data.
     - **Potential Duplicate Emails:** The `send_email` method does not check if an email has already been sent, which could result in duplicate emails being sent to the user.
     - **Lack of Error Handling:** The `send_mails` function is called without proper error handling, which could lead to a denial of service if the function takes an unexpected amount of time or throws an error.

   - **Token Management:**
     - **Token Validity Check:** The `get_token` method checks if a token exists but does not properly invalidate or manage tokens, which could lead to token reuse or stale tokens.
     - **Context Variables:** The use of `PLAN_CONTEXT_EMAIL_SENT` and `PLAN_CONTEXT_EMAIL_OVERRIDE` without proper management could lead to unintended email sending.

   - **Security Practices:**
     - **No Encryption:** Sensitive data like passwords and login tokens are not encrypted, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
     - **Insecure Reverse:** While `reverse` is generally safe when used within the same request, it's not a direct security risk here but could be a code smell.

   - **Code Practices:**
     - **No Immediate Return:** The `send_mails` function is called without returning control to the server, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function fails.
     - **No Logging:** There is no logging for failed email sends, which could make debugging difficult in case of issues.

2. **Recommendations:**

   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Ensure that all sensitive user data, including emails and passwords, are encrypted both at rest and in transit.
   - **Implement Proper Error Handling:** Add error handling around the `send_mails` function to prevent denial of service and provide meaningful error","CVE: CVE-2023-39522

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
