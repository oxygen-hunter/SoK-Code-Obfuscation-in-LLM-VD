CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Untrusted Deserialization (Line 97): The code uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize data from the network, which can lead to remote code execution if the data is maliciously crafted. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. 
   - Insecure Randomness (Line 29): The `random_function()` is a meaningless function that does not provide any security benefit and can be used to confuse code auditors. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
   - Opaque Predicate (Line 33): The `random_function()` is used as an opaque predicate, which is a condition that is always true or false but is obfuscated to make it appear complex. This can make the code harder to analyze and may introduce unnecessary complexity.
   - Insufficient Input Validation (Line 123, 135): The code does not perform sufficient input validation when parsing addresses entered by the user. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
   - Lack of Error Handling (Line 141, 153): The code catches exceptions using a broad `except` clause without providing specific error messages or handling different exception types appropriately. This can make it difficult to diagnose and troubleshoot issues.
   - Hardcoded Secrets (Line 147): The code contains hardcoded values for the SLPADDR_PREFIX, which may expose sensitive information and make it easier for attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Insecure Cryptographic Practices (Line 161): The code uses a weak cryptographic algorithm to generate tokens, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as token forgery or manipulation.
   - Lack of Proper Authentication (Line 191): The code does not enforce proper authentication mechanisms before performing sensitive operations, which can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the application.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using `pickle.loads()` for deserialization and consider using safer alternatives like JSON or Protobuf.
   - Remove unnecessary and confusing code like `random_function()` and `opaque predicates` to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Implement proper input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
   - Use secure cryptographic algorithms and best practices for generating tokens and handling sensitive information.
   - Enhance error handling by providing specific error messages and handling exceptions based on their types to improve code robustness.
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys or prefixes and consider using secure storage mechanisms.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness: The `confusion_generator` function uses the `random.choice` function to generate a random boolean value. This method is not cryptographically secure and should not be used for security-sensitive applications. An attacker may predict or manipulate the outcome of the random choice, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

     - Reason: Insecure randomness can lead to predictability and manipulation by an attacker.

   - Unused Variable: The code contains an unused variable `unused_variable = 42`. Unused variables can clutter the codebase and may indicate incomplete code cleanup or potential logic errors.
     - Vulnerable line: `unused_variable = 42`
     - Reason: Unused variables should be removed to maintain code clarity and avoid confusion.

   - Unnecessary Code: The code contains unnecessary code blocks that do not contribute to the functionality of the program. For example, the assignment `dummy_check = retval == 0` and the variable `random_value = random.randint(0, 100)` are not used in any meaningful way and can be considered unnecessary.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       - `dummy_check = retval == 0`

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `delete_group` function at line 29: The code does not properly validate the ownership of the group before allowing deletion. An attacker could potentially delete any group by sending a DELETE request to `/groups/<group_name>` endpoint without proper authorization.
   - SQL Injection in `get_group` function at line 45: The code constructs a SQL query using string concatenation without sanitizing user input. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `group_name` parameter is controlled by an attacker.
   - Lack of Input Validation in `post_group` function at line 77: The code does not validate the `userids` input received in the request body before processing it. This can lead to various security issues such as unexpected behavior or data corruption.

3. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to IDOR, SQL Injection, and lack of input validation.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - SQL Injection: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of string formatting in the SQL query construction. This vulnerability can be found in the `create_poll` function on lines 53-56 and `do_poll` function on lines 79-86. An attacker can manipulate the input data to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
   
   - Lack of Input Validation: The code lacks proper input validation which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. For example, in the `do_poll` function on lines 79-86, the code does not validate the input data before processing it, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
   
   - Lack of Error Handling: The code lacks proper error handling mechanisms. For example, in the `create_poll` function on lines 53-56 and `do_poll` function on lines 79-86, the exceptions are caught but the error messages are directly exposed to the user, which can leak sensitive information and aid attackers in exploiting the system.
   
   - Lack of Authentication and Authorization: The code does not implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive functionalities. For example, in the `create_poll` function on lines 53-56, anyone can create a poll without proper authentication.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness (Line 33): The `random_check` method uses the `random.choice` function to return a random boolean value. This method is not suitable for cryptographic purposes as it does not provide secure randomness.
   - Command Injection (Line 77): The `fmt_re.sub` method uses the `repl` method as a replacement function. The `repl` method dynamically evaluates the attribute obtained from the regex match group, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 77): The `fmt_re.sub` method does not validate the input obtained from the regex match group before using it in the replacement function, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
   - Lack of Error Handling (Line 77): The `fmt_re.sub` method does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during attribute retrieval using `getattr`, which can result in unhandled exceptions and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure randomness, command injection, lack of input validation, and lack of error handling.

4. Recommendation:

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness (Line 22, Line 38):
     The `random` module is used for generating random numbers, but the randomness is not cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable behavior in security-sensitive functions.
   - Pickle Deserialization (Line 15, Line 94):
     The code uses `cPickle` to serialize and deserialize objects. Deserializing untrusted data from an unauthenticated source using `cPickle` can lead to code execution vulnerabilities.
   - Unhandled Exception (Line 45, Line 77):
     There are places in the code where exceptions are not handled properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 94):
     The code does not validate the input received before deserializing it using `cPickle`, which can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.

3. Reason for Vulnerability:
   - Insecure Randomness: The `random` module is used without specifying a secure random number generator.
   - Pickle Deserialization: Deserializing data using `cPickle` can execute arbitrary code if the input is not properly validated.
   - Unhandled Exception: Lack of proper exception handling can expose sensitive information or cause the program to crash unexpectedly.
   - Lack of Input Validation: Deserializing untrusted input without validation can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.

4. Recommendation:
   - Use a cryptographically secure random number generator like `secrets` module for secure randomness.
   - Avoid using `cPickle` for deserialization of untrusted data. Consider using safer alternatives like JSON.
   - Implement proper exception handling to gracefully handle errors and prevent information leakage.
   - Validate input data before deserialization to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2021-3620

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

     - Reason: Storing passwords in SHA-256 format without salting is not secure. It is recommended to use a more secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt with salt.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Sanitize user inputs before using them in functions like `os.walk`, `os.makedirs`, and HTML responses to prevent command injection, path traversal, and XSS vulnerabilities.

     - Vulnerable lines:
       ```python
       elif username == cred.loginname and pwdreshash == cred.loginpass:
       ```
     - Reason: Hardcoded credentials make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

   - Command Injection: The code uses `os.system` to execute shell commands without proper input validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       ```python
       os.system(arg)
       ```
     - Reason: User input `arg` is directly passed to the `os.system` function without proper sanitization, allowing for potential command injection attacks.

   - Unrestricted File Write: The code allows writing to files without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       ```python
       self.file = open(arg, 'w')

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates the wrong bytecode. Any contract that uses the `raw_call` with `revert_on_failure=False` and `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory garbage, the result can be either `True` or `False`. A patch is available and, as of time of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a workaround, one may always put  `max_outsize>0`.

CVE Description: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function, it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
