CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Infinite Loop: The code contains multiple while loops without a clear exit condition, which can lead to an infinite loop. This can be seen in functions like `environ_setting`, `configure`, `options`, `get`, `__getitem__`, and `__str__`.
   - Command Injection: The code uses `os.path.expanduser` and `os.path.abspath` without validating user input, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. This can be seen in the `CONF_PATHS` list initialization.
   - Unsafe YAML Loading: The code uses `yaml.safe_load` to load configuration files, but it does not validate or sanitize the input data, which can lead to YAML injection vulnerabilities. This can be seen in the `load` method of the `Configuration` class.

3. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to the presence of infinite loops, command injection, and unsafe YAML loading.

4. Recommendation: 
   - Add proper exit conditions to the while loops to prevent infinite loops.
   - Validate user input before using functions like `os.path.expanduser` and `os.path.abspath`.
   - Validate and sanitize input data before using `yaml.safe_load` to prevent YAML injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2017-16763

55_pathutils.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `sanitize_path` function, the code does not properly handle user-controlled input, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the function does not adequately prevent access to other data outside the intended directory. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the path and access sensitive files on the system.
     Vulnerable line: 
     ```python
     new_path = posixpath.join(new_path, part)
     ```
     Reason: The code does not check for directory traversal characters like "".."" which can be abused by an attacker.

   - In the `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function, the code does not sufficiently validate the path components for safe filesystem operations. It allows for potential path manipulation attacks by not properly checking for special characters or patterns that could lead to directory traversal.
     Vulnerable line:
     ```python
     return True
     ```
     Reason: The function does not thoroughly validate the path components, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

   - In the `path_to_filesystem` function, the code uses the `sanitize_path` function which has path traversal vulnerabilities. This can lead to an insecure conversion of the path to a local filesystem path relative to the base folder, potentially allowing an attacker to access unauthorized files on the system.
     Vulnerable line:
     ```python
     safe_path = os.path.join(safe_path, part)
     ```
     Reason: The code relies on the potentially vulnerable `sanitize_path` function for path manipulation, which can result in path traversal vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent path traversal attacks.
   - Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the standard library to ensure safe filesystem operations.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3.

Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways.

All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization (Line 13): The code imports the `decode_base64` function from the `unpaddedbase64` module, which can be used for deserialization of potentially malicious data. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as code execution or data manipulation if untrusted input is passed to this function.
   - Malicious Code Execution (Line 97): The `parse_auth_header` function does not properly handle exceptions when parsing the Authorization header, which can lead to a `SignatureVerifyException` being raised with a generic message. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code or disrupt the application's functionality.
3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization and potential malicious code execution.
4. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and error handling mechanisms to prevent insecure deserialization and ensure secure parsing of the Authorization header.","CVE: CVE-2021-29430
CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

CVE Description: CairoSVG is a Python (pypi) package. CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo. In CairoSVG before version 2.5.1, there is a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. When processing SVG files, the python package CairoSVG uses two regular expressions which are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS). If an attacker provides a malicious SVG, it can make cairosvg get stuck processing the file for a very long time. This is fixed in version 2.5.1. See Referenced GitHub advisory for more information.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

139_oauth2_root.py,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Insecure Direct Object References
   Vulnerable Line: 26
   Reason: The code directly retrieves the refresh token from the request.POST dictionary without proper validation or authorization checks, which can lead to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 32
   Reason: The code does not validate the input 'expire_seconds' obtained from the settings.OAUTH2_PROVIDER, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 38
   Reason: The code catches and returns the exception message as part of the response, which can potentially leak sensitive information to attackers.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of CSRF Protection
   Vulnerable Line: 44
   Reason: The code does not include any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms, which can make the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Authentication and Authorization
   Vulnerable Line: 20-44
   Reason: The code lacks proper authentication and authorization checks when handling refresh tokens, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure Communication
   Vulnerable Line: N/A
   Reason: The code does not enforce secure communication (e.g., HTTPS) for token-related operations, which can expose sensitive information to eavesdropping attacks.

8. Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Secret
   Vulnerable Line: N/A
   Reason: The code may contain hardcoded secrets or sensitive information that should be securely managed and stored.

9. Vulnerability Type: Deprecated Libraries
   Vulnerable Line: 5
   Reason: The code imports deprecated libraries like oauthlib and oauth2_provider, which may have known security vulnerabilities or lack of support.

10. Vulnerability Type: Unused Imports
    Vulnerable Line: N/A
    Reason: The code includes unused imports (e.g., timedelta, now) that can clutter the codebase and potentially introduce vulnerabilities if left unattended.","CVE: CVE-2020-10709
CVE Description: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.

CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates the wrong bytecode. Any contract that uses the `raw_call` with `revert_on_failure=False` and `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory garbage, the result can be either `True` or `False`. A patch is available and, as of time of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a workaround, one may always put  `max_outsize>0`.

CVE Description: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function, it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.

2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 97, 105
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to code injection due to the use of dynamic code execution with the `exec` statement. The `__block` variable is used to control the flow of execution, and the code within the while loop can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 97, 105
   Reason: The code reveals sensitive information about the application's behavior and structure by exposing the control flow logic and session handling mechanisms. This information could be leveraged by attackers to understand the inner workings of the application and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: 105
   Reason: The code lacks proper error handling mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions not being caught and handled appropriately. This could result in application instability or security issues.","CVE: CVE-2023-30861
CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `test_invalid_signature` function, there is a vulnerability related to an incomplete signature verification process. The `ecrecover` function is called with only three parameters (hash, v, r) but it requires four parameters (hash, v, r, s). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

   - In the `test_ecrecover_test` function, there is a vulnerability related to the usage of hardcoded values for testing `ecrecover` function. Hardcoding values like private keys, hashes, and signatures in the contract code can expose sensitive information and weaken the security of the system.

3. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to incomplete signature verification and the usage of hardcoded values for testing.

4. Note: The code should be reviewed and updated to ensure proper signature verification and avoid using hardcoded values for testing.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.
