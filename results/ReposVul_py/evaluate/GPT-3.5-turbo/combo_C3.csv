1_chroot.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Command Injection: The `_generate_cmd` method in the `Connection` class is vulnerable to command injection due to the way it constructs the command string using user-controlled input (`executable` and `cmd`). This can lead to arbitrary command execution.
     - Vulnerable lines: 96-104
     - Reason: The method constructs the command string without proper validation or sanitization of the input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the command and execute arbitrary commands.

3. Recommendation:
   - Validate and sanitize the input parameters (`executable` and `cmd`) before constructing the command string to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
   - Consider using safer alternatives like subprocess module's `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False` and passing arguments as a list to avoid command injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2015-6240

   - Insecure subprocess usage: 
     - Vulnerable lines: 77, 85, 97, 108, 119, 130, 141
     - Reason: The code uses subprocess.Popen without proper input validation and sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if user-controlled input is passed to these subprocess calls.
   - Lack of input validation in `_search_executable` method:
     - Vulnerable line: 61
     - Reason: The `_search_executable` method does not validate the input `executable` parameter before using it in the `find_executable` call, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
   - Lack of error handling in `put_file` and `fetch_file` methods:
     - Vulnerable lines: 174, 189
     - Reason: The `put_file` and `fetch_file` methods do not handle exceptions properly, which can lead to information disclosure or denial of service if an error occurs during file transfer operations.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Sanitize user input before passing it to subprocess calls.
   - Implement proper input validation in the `_search_executable` method.
   - Add error handling and proper exception management in file transfer methods.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure PID file handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 38, 47, 58, 69
     - Reason: The code uses a fixed path for the PID file (""/var/run/pyro-%s.pid"") without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to a potential security risk if an attacker can manipulate the path or contents of the PID file.
   - Lack of input validation:
     - Vulnerable lines: 84, 96
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input provided through the command line arguments, which can lead to command injection or unexpected behavior.
   - Lack of error handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 96
     - Reason: The code does not handle errors that may occur during the process_command_line method, which can result in unexpected behavior or denial of service.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Use a more secure method for handling PID files, such as creating the file in a secure directory with proper permissions and validating user input to prevent command injection.
   - Implement proper error handling to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.

CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3.

CVE Description: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.
 This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.

This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

24___init__.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Code Injection Vulnerability:
     - Vulnerable lines: 56
     - Reason: The code uses `globals()` function to dynamically set a global variable based on the value popped from the stack during the execution of the VM instructions. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if an attacker controls the input values passed to the `STORE` instruction. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `var` value to overwrite any global variable in the program, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using `globals()` function to dynamically set global variables based on user-controlled input. Instead, consider using a predefined set of variables or a safer mechanism to handle variable assignments.

4. Note:
   - The code also raises an `ImportError` if the condition `globals().get('result', 1) < 0` is met. This condition seems to be related to the Python version check, but the specific behavior and impact of this check are not fully clear without additional context.","CVE: CVE-2023-24816
CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - Insecure Deserialization (YAML.load): The code uses `yaml.safe_load` to deserialize YAML data, which is generally safer than using `yaml.load`. However, deserializing untrusted YAML data can still lead to code execution vulnerabilities if the data contains malicious code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```python
       ('CONFIGURE', yaml.safe_load(conf))
       ```
     - Reason: Deserializing untrusted data can lead to code execution vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation:
   - Validate and sanitize the YAML data before deserializing it to prevent code execution vulnerabilities. Implement strict input validation and only deserialize data from trusted sources.

4. Note:
   - The code may have other security vulnerabilities that were not detected in this analysis. Further review and testing are recommended to ensure the code's security posture.","CVE: CVE-2017-16763

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

   - Insecure Deserialization (Line 38, Line 52, Line 66, Line 80): The code uses a custom stack-based VM to execute programs defined as a list of tuples. The program is loaded and executed without any validation or sanitization, which can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the program data is coming from an untrusted source. An attacker could potentially craft malicious programs to exploit the VM and execute arbitrary code.

3. Recommendation:

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization (Potential): The code uses a custom virtual machine (VM) to execute instructions provided as a list of tuples. This approach can be risky as it allows arbitrary code execution and could potentially lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the instructions are not properly validated. The vulnerabilities are present in the `get_public_key`, `add_public_key`, `delete_public_key`, and `get_public_keys_of_user` functions where instructions are passed to the `vm_execute` function without proper validation.

3. Reason: The custom VM implementation lacks proper input validation and sanitization, making it susceptible to code injection attacks.

4. Recommendation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent code injection vulnerabilities. Consider using safer alternatives for executing instructions dynamically.","CVE: CVE-2022-4768

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

         - `cur.execute('''DROP USER ""{}"";'''.format(get_normalized_username(username))` in `vm_delete_user`
     - Reason: Constructing SQL queries by directly formatting strings with user inputs makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code uses string formatting to construct SQL queries instead of using parameterized queries, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.

2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 38, 47
   Reason: The code uses a custom virtual machine (VM) to execute instructions provided in the form of a list of tuples. The instructions are not sanitized or validated before execution, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially craft malicious instructions to manipulate the VM's stack and control the program flow.

CVE Description: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens. A fix is available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

   - Insecure Randomness: The code uses the `secrets.choice` function to generate random characters for passwords. However, the usage of `secrets.choice` with a fixed set of characters (e.g., `string.ascii_letters + string.digits`) may not provide sufficient randomness for secure password generation.

   - The code does not validate the input parameters before using them, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.
   - Using a custom password comparison function instead of a secure method like bcrypt can introduce vulnerabilities like timing attacks.

It is recommended to implement input validation for user inputs and use a secure password comparison method to improve the security of the code.","CVE: CVE-2014-125056

CVE Description: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

CVE Description: goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine if a username exists. Only setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions 2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

     - Reason: The code uses `os.getenv` and `os.environ` to handle environment variables without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to security risks such as command injection or information disclosure.

3. Recommendation:
   - Validate and sanitize user input when interacting with environment variables to prevent security vulnerabilities. Consider using a safe method to handle environment variables, such as a configuration library or framework that provides secure access to environment variables.","CVE: CVE-2023-2780

201_auth.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Logging (Line 97, Line 123): The code uses the `logging` module to log sensitive information such as API keys, secret file paths, and authentication details. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information if the logs are not properly secured or if an attacker gains access to the logs.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 108, Line 114, Line 120): The code does not perform input validation on user-provided data such as API keys, filenames, environment variable names, email, and password. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks, data manipulation, and unauthorized access.
   - Lack of Error Handling (Line 77, Line 89, Line 101, Line 139): The code lacks proper error handling mechanisms. For example, exceptions are raised but not caught or handled appropriately, which can result in application crashes or unexpected behavior.
   - Insecure JWT Configuration (Line 123): The code uses `jwt.decode` with the option `verify_signature=False`, which disables signature verification for JWT tokens. This can lead to token tampering and unauthorized access if the tokens are not properly validated.
   - Insecure File Permissions (Line 148): The code sets file permissions using `stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR`, which grants read and write permissions to the owner only. However, this may not be sufficient to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement secure logging practices by avoiding logging sensitive information.
   - Perform input validation on user-provided data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - Implement proper error handling to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
   - Avoid disabling signature verification for JWT tokens unless absolutely necessary.
   - Ensure proper file permissions are set to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access.","CVE: CVE-2023-32303

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature.
