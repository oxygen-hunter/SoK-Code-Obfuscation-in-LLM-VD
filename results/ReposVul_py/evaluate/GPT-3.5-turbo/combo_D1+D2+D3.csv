2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Hardcoded Credentials: The code contains hardcoded credentials in the form of the root user check `if os.geteuid() != 0 * 10:`. This can expose sensitive information and is a security risk. (Line 23)
   - Command Injection: The `_generate_cmd` method constructs a command using user input without proper validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. (Line 38)
   - Insecure subprocess call: The `_buffered_exec_command` method uses `subprocess.Popen` without proper input validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. (Line 46)
   - Lack of Input Validation: The code lacks proper input validation in methods like `put_file` and `fetch_file`, which can lead to path traversal attacks. (Line 74, 89)

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Command Injection: The `_search_executable` method is vulnerable to command injection on lines 18-20. The `distutils.spawn.find_executable` function is used to search for an executable, but the `executable` parameter is not sanitized before being passed to the function. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `executable` parameter to execute arbitrary commands.
   - Code Injection: The `_generate_cmd` method is vulnerable to code injection on lines 64-66. The method constructs a command string using user-controlled input (`executable` and `cmd`) without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the command string.
   - Information Disclosure: The `fetch_file` method is vulnerable to information disclosure on lines 123-129. The method reads data from the subprocess stdout without proper error handling. If an error occurs during reading, the method still tries to read from the stdout, potentially leaking sensitive information.

CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization (Line 61): The code uses the `pickle` module for deserialization, which can lead to code execution vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the server.
   - Command Injection (Line 77): The code constructs a command using user-controlled input (`file_path`) without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the `file_path` to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
   - Path Traversal (Line 79): The code does not properly validate the `file_path` before extracting files from the archive, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious archive to overwrite or access sensitive files on the server.
   - Arbitrary File Write (Line 85): The code writes files to the server's filesystem based on user-controlled input (`file_path`), which can lead to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. An attacker could write malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server.
   - Information Disclosure (Line 91): The code reveals potentially sensitive information about the server's directory structure by listing files in the temporary directory. This information disclosure could aid attackers in further exploiting the system.

3. Reason: The code contains multiple security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the server's integrity and confidentiality.

4. Recommendation: 
   - Avoid using `pickle` for deserialization due to its security risks. Consider using safer alternatives like JSON.
   - Validate and sanitize user input, especially when constructing commands or file paths, to prevent injection attacks.
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
   - Restrict file write operations to specific directories and avoid writing user-controlled data to arbitrary locations.
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information about the server's filesystem to potential attackers.","CVE: CVE-2023-30620

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade.

A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Vulnerability Type: CSV Injection
     - Vulnerable Lines: 20
     - Reason: The code is attempting to prevent CSV Injection by stripping illegal leading characters from the exported data. However, the implementation is incorrect and ineffective. The while loop condition `while (999-999) == 0 and len(val) > ((99-90)/9)-1 and val[0] in illegal_start_vals` is convoluted and does not effectively prevent CSV Injection. Additionally, the list `illegal_start_vals` contains incorrect values and is missing some common characters used in CSV Injection attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Dialect Definitions:
     - Vulnerable lines: 16, 27
     - Reason: The delimiter, quotechar, lineterminator values in the `CrLfDialect` and `LfDialect` classes are defined using string concatenation with empty strings. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to define these values directly as single characters without concatenation.
   - Unsafe Constructor Registration:
     - Vulnerable line: 32
     - Reason: Registering a constructor for a specific YAML tag using `SafeLoader.add_constructor` can introduce security risks if not properly validated. It's recommended to carefully validate and sanitize the input data to prevent potential YAML injection attacks.
   - Command Injection:
     - Vulnerable lines: 94, 98
     - Reason: The `crlf` and `lf` dialects are dynamically constructed using string concatenation based on the `crlf` and `lf` values. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the values are controlled by an attacker. It's recommended to avoid constructing dialect names dynamically based on user-controlled input.
   - Incorrect Logical Operators:
     - Vulnerable lines: 101, 105, 109, 113, 117
     - Reason: The logical operators `||` and `&&` are used in a non-standard way in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential logic errors. It's recommended to use the standard logical operators `or` and `and` for clarity and correctness.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Refactor the code to address the identified vulnerabilities and follow best practices for secure coding.
   - Avoid concatenating strings to define dialect properties.
   - Validate and sanitize input data before registering YAML constructors.
   - Avoid constructing dialect names dynamically based on user input.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization (YAML.load): 
     - Vulnerable lines: 10
     - Reason: The code uses `yaml.load` to load a YAML file without specifying any restrictions on the content that can be loaded. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the YAML file is controlled by an attacker.

   - Code Injection (exec function): 
     - Vulnerable lines: 38, 47
     - Reason: The code uses the `exec` function to execute code dynamically based on the content of files read from the filesystem. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the files are controlled by an attacker.

   - Command Injection (os.makedirs): 
     - Vulnerable lines: 123
     - Reason: The code uses user-controlled input to create directories using `os.makedirs` without proper validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using `yaml.load` and switch to `yaml.safe_load` to mitigate the Insecure Deserialization vulnerability.
   - Avoid using `exec` function for executing dynamic code. Consider alternative approaches.
   - Sanitize user-controlled input before using it in functions like `os.makedirs` to prevent Command Injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2022-0697

   - Lack of input validation in the `parse_address` method at line 97. The method does not validate the input address format, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
   - Lack of proper exception handling in the `mint_token` method at lines 139-141. The exceptions are caught but not handled appropriately, leading to potential information disclosure.
   - Lack of proper input validation in the `check_token_qty` method at line 277. The method does not validate the token quantity input, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Reason: The code contains several vulnerabilities related to authorization, input validation, exception handling, and potential information disclosure.
4. Recommendation: Implement proper authorization checks, input validation, exception handling, and ensure sensitive information is not exposed in error messages to enhance the security of the code.","CVE: CVE-2020-11014
CVE Description: Electron-Cash-SLP before version 3.6.2 has a vulnerability. All token creators that use the ""Mint Tool"" feature of the Electron Cash SLP Edition are at risk of sending the minting authority baton to the wrong SLP address. Sending the mint baton to the wrong address will give another party the ability to issue new tokens or permanently destroy future minting capability. This is fixed version 3.6.2.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

   - Command Injection vulnerability in the `crack_first_line` method at line 148. The method is using regex to parse the HTTP request line, but the regex pattern is not secure and can be exploited for command injection attacks.
   - Potential SQL Injection vulnerability in the `split_uri` method at line 107. The method is splitting the URI components without proper validation, which can lead to SQL injection if the URI is used in database queries.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

     - Reason: The `CALLOC.argtypes` should be a list of ctypes types, not a list of integers. The correct definition should be `CALLOC.argtypes = [c_int, c_int]` instead of `CALLOC.argtypes = [(100-99)*50, (10*10)-99]`.
   
   - Type: Typo in Function Definition
     - Vulnerable Line: 16
     - Reason: There is a typo in the function definition `STRDUP.argstypes`, it should be `STRDUP.argtypes`.

   - Type: Incorrect String Formatting
     - Vulnerable Lines: 27, 33
     - Reason: The string formatting in the `__repr__` methods of `PamMessage` and `PamResponse` classes is incorrect. It should be `'<PamMessage %i %s>' % (self.msg_style, self.msg)` and `'<PamResponse %i %s>' % (self.resp_retcode, self.resp)` respectively.

   - Type: Incorrect Comparison

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

The method compares the URL path with trusted domains to determine if the certificate URL is valid. However, the comparison logic is flawed and can be bypassed by an attacker. An attacker can manipulate the URL to point to a malicious domain and potentially download a malicious certificate.
   - Insecure Deserialization vulnerability in the `is_verified` method at line 41. The method decodes a base64-encoded signature and performs signature verification using cryptography libraries. However, the deserialized signature is not validated for potential malicious content, which can lead to deserialization attacks.
   - Insufficient Logging vulnerability in the `confirm_sns_subscription` function at line 189. The function logs sensitive information such as the subscription confirmation URL without proper sanitization or obfuscation, which can expose sensitive data to attackers.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

     - Vulnerable lines: `line 47`
     - Reason: SHA-1 is known to have vulnerabilities and is not recommended for cryptographic purposes.
   
   - XML Entity Expansion (XXE) Injection: The code uses `etree.fromstring` to parse XML content without disabling external entity resolution. This can lead to XXE attacks where an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server or perform SSRF attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness (generate_key function):
     - Line 47: The `generate_key` function uses the `secrets.token_bytes` function to generate a random key. However, the key is encoded using base32 encoding, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic purposes. It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `secrets.token_urlsafe` for generating secure random keys.

   - Hardcoded Secrets (ConfirmationKeyException):
     - Line 19: The `ConfirmationKeyException` class defines error types using mathematical operations on hardcoded values. Hardcoding sensitive information like error codes can expose the application to potential attacks. It is recommended to use more secure methods for defining error types.

   - Timing Attack (get_object_from_key function):
     - Line 61: The `get_object_from_key` function uses a timing-sensitive comparison with `assert` to check if an object is not equal to a specific value. This can potentially leak information through timing attacks. It is recommended to use constant-time comparison functions like `django.utils.crypto.constant_time_compare` to mitigate timing attacks.

   - SQL Injection (confirmation_url function):
     - Line 101: The `confirmation_url` function constructs a URL using string concatenation without proper sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is included in the URL. It is recommended to use proper URL encoding functions like `urllib.parse.urlencode` to prevent SQL injection.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Logging: The code uses string concatenation to create the logger name, which can potentially lead to log injection attacks. (Line 10)
   - Potential Command Injection: The code constructs the logger name using string slicing, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. (Line 77)
   - Lack of Input Sanitization: The code concatenates strings without proper input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. (Multiple lines)
   - Lack of Exception Handling: The code catches generic exceptions without specific handling, which can hide potential issues and make debugging difficult. (Multiple lines)

3. Reason: The code contains multiple vulnerabilities related to insecure logging, potential command injection, lack of input sanitization, and lack of proper exception handling.

4. Recommendation: 
   - Use secure logging practices such as string formatting with placeholders instead of concatenation.
   - Avoid constructing sensitive data using string manipulation operations.
   - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent unexpected behavior.
   - Use specific exception handling to improve error reporting and handling.","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

   - Insecure Regular Expression: The regular expression used in the `AUTO_LINK` variable is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack due to the presence of nested quantifiers and backtracking. This can lead to a denial of service by causing the regex engine to excessively backtrack on certain inputs.

166_flagging.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `SimpleCSVLogger` and `CSVLogger` classes, there is a vulnerability related to the use of the `eval` function in the `os.makedirs` call. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the `flagging_dir` string is controlled by an attacker. The vulnerable lines are:
     - `os.makedirs(flagging_dir, exist_ok=(1 == 2) || (not False || True || 1==1))` in both `SimpleCSVLogger` and `CSVLogger` classes.
     - **Reason**: The `eval` function is used to evaluate the expression provided as a string, which can be dangerous if the input is not sanitized properly.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using the `eval` function and directly passing expressions as arguments to functions like `os.makedirs`. Instead, validate and sanitize the input before using it in such functions to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2022-24770
CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 174-183
     - Reason: The code stores the password in SHA-256 hash format in the configuration file and compares the user input password directly with the stored hash. This is not a secure way to handle passwords as the hash can be easily reversed using rainbow tables or brute force attacks. It's recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 with salt for storing passwords securely.

3. Recommendation: Implement a secure password hashing mechanism using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 with a unique salt for each user to securely store and verify passwords.

183_vhost.py,"1. YES
2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 30, 32
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to code injection attacks in the `_getResourceForRequest` method. The `host` variable is constructed by concatenating strings obtained from the request headers without proper sanitization, which can allow an attacker to manipulate the `host` value and potentially execute arbitrary code.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 32
   Reason: The code lacks input validation on the `host` value obtained from the request headers. Without proper validation, it can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: 38
   Reason: The code does not handle the case where the requested host is not found in the `hosts` dictionary. This can lead to unhandled exceptions or unexpected behavior.","CVE: CVE-2022-39348
CVE Description: Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Hashing Algorithm: The code uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for hashing passwords, which is generally considered secure. However, the implementation of the `hash_password` method concatenates the password, salt, and iterations directly without using a secure delimiter. This can potentially lead to hash collisions and weaken the security of the hashing mechanism. Vulnerable lines: 96, 97, 98, 99. Reason: Insecure concatenation of password, salt, and iterations for hashing.
   - Password Hashing in `__setattr__` Method: The `__setattr__` method in the `BaseUser` class hashes the password if it does not start with 'pbkdf2_sha256'. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues if the password is hashed multiple times. Vulnerable line: 107. Reason: Unnecessary rehashing of passwords.
   - Excessive Logging of Passwords: The code logs excessively long passwords and usernames, which can potentially expose sensitive information in the logs. Vulnerable lines: 126, 134. Reason: Logging of sensitive information.

3. Recommendation:
   - Use a secure delimiter when concatenating password, salt, and iterations in the `hash_password` method to prevent hash collisions.
   - Avoid rehashing passwords unnecessarily in the `__setattr__` method to prevent potential issues.
   - Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords and usernames to prevent exposure of sensitive data.

4. Note: The codebase seems to have implemented password hashing using PBKDF2 with SHA-256, which is a good practice. However, the vulnerabilities mentioned above should be addressed to enhance the overall security of the application.","CVE: CVE-2023-41885
CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

   - Line 10: `with open('a' + 'ssets/custom.c' + 'ss', 'r', encoding='ut' + 'f-8') as f:`
   - Line 12: `customCSS = f.read()`
4. Reason: The code is vulnerable to code injection due to the use of string concatenation in the file path. An attacker could manipulate the file path by injecting malicious code, leading to potential security risks such as reading sensitive files or executing arbitrary code. It is recommended to avoid string concatenation for file paths and use a secure method to handle file operations.","CVE: CVE-2023-34094

205_test_ecrecover.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `test_invalid_signature` function, the code is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack due to the use of `ecrecover` function. The vulnerable line is `s: uint256 = self.dummies[msg.sender][msg.sender]`. This line reads from a hashmap and can potentially lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

3. Reason:
   - The code allows for potential reentrancy attacks as it reads from a hashmap in the `test_invalid_signature` function without proper checks and handling.

4. Recommendation:
   - Ensure proper handling of external calls and state changes to prevent reentrancy attacks. Implement checks to prevent unexpected behavior when interacting with external contracts or data.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.

4. Recommendation: Avoid hardcoding credentials in the code. Instead, use secure methods for handling credentials such as environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.","CVE: CVE-2023-38699
CVE Description: MindsDB's AI Virtual Database allows developers to connect any AI/ML model to any datasource. Prior to version 23.7.4.0, a call to requests with `verify=False` disables SSL certificate checks. This rule enforces always verifying SSL certificates for methods in the Requests library.

   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `task_activity_callback` function:
