   - Lack of Input Validation:
     - Vulnerable lines: 24, 33, 42, 51
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input file paths obtained from the configuration file before attempting to open and read them. This can lead to path traversal attacks or file disclosure vulnerabilities.

   - Lack of Error Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 33, 42
     - Reason: The code catches exceptions but does not handle them appropriately. For example, in the `makeTrustRoot` method, an exception is caught but then re-raised without proper handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

   - Lack of SSL/TLS Best Practices:
     - Vulnerable lines: 24, 33, 42, 51

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - Insecure Comparison (Line 46, Line 58):
     The code uses the ""is"" operator for comparing strings in the exception handling blocks. The ""is"" operator checks for object identity, not equality. It is recommended to use the ""=="" operator for string comparison.
   
   - Lack of Input Sanitization (Line 30, Line 51):
     The code does not properly sanitize the input parameters 'rdtype' and 'ip' before using them in DNS queries. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks.
   
   - Lack of Error Handling for DNS Query Results (Line 64, Line 85):
     The code does not handle the case where the 'answer' variable might be None after the DNS query. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potential information disclosure.
   
   - Lack of Rate Limiting or Throttling:
     The code does not implement any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for DNS queries. This can make the application vulnerable to abuse or DoS attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization (YAML.load): The code uses `yaml.load` to load the configuration file, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is controlled by an attacker. This vulnerability is present in the `load_config` function at line 13. It is recommended to use `yaml.safe_load` instead of `yaml.load` to mitigate this vulnerability.
   - Code Injection (exec): The code uses the `exec` function to execute user-defined code from the hooks and scraping files. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. This vulnerability is present in the `load_hooks` and `load_scraper` functions at lines 35 and 45. It is recommended to avoid using `exec` and find alternative solutions.
   - Command Injection (os.makedirs): The code uses user-controlled input to create directories using `os.makedirs`. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized properly. This vulnerability is present in the `create_plugin_dir` function at line 129. It is recommended to validate and sanitize user input before using it in system commands.
   - Unsafe Redirect (URL): The code does not properly validate the redirect URL in the `is_safe_redirect_url` function at line 159. This can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities where an attacker can craft malicious URLs to redirect users to malicious websites. It is recommended to validate and sanitize the redirect URL properly.

3. Reason: The code contains multiple security vulnerabilities that can lead to code execution, code injection, command injection, and open redirect vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Lack of input validation in `get_serializer` function: The `get_serializer` function does not validate the input properly. It directly uses the input values without any validation, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities like injection attacks or unexpected behavior. Specifically, the function does not validate the input values for ""serializer"" and ""content-type"" keys before using them to retrieve the serializer objects from dictionaries `a` and `b`. An attacker could potentially manipulate these values to cause unexpected behavior or errors.

2. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: 34
   Reason: The code at line 34 is vulnerable to code injection as it directly serializes and executes the content of the `t_headers` dictionary using `json.dumps()`. An attacker could potentially manipulate the HTTP headers to inject malicious code which would be executed when the `t_method` function is called.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 22
   Reason: The code at line 22 does not validate the input properly before accessing the `t_logger` attribute of the `handler` object. If the `handler` object does not have the `log` attribute, it falls back to using `global_metrics[""access""]` which may not be intended behavior and could lead to unexpected results.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Line: 22
   Reason: The code at line 22 does not handle the AttributeError exception that may occur when trying to access the `log` attribute of the `handler` object. This lack of error handling could lead to uncaught exceptions and potential application crashes.","CVE: CVE-2022-24757
CVE Description: The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

2. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Line: 123
   Reason: The `generate_malt_command` method constructs a command to be executed using subprocess. The `inputfilename` parameter is not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: 123
   Reason: The `generate_malt_command` method includes the model filename in the command without proper validation. This could potentially leak sensitive information about the file system structure.

4. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: 123
   Reason: The `generate_malt_command` method constructs a command using user-controlled input (`self.model`). If an attacker can control the model filename, they could potentially inject malicious code into the command.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: 123
   Reason: The `generate_malt_command` method does not validate the inputfilename parameter before using it to construct a command. This lack of input validation could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.","CVE: CVE-2021-3842

CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`.

2. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 24, 30
   Reason: The code is using the `string.lower()` method to convert the host header to lowercase for comparison. This can lead to a vulnerability as the `string.lower()` method is deprecated in Python 3 and can cause issues with Unicode characters. It is recommended to use `str.lower()` instead.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 24, 30
   Reason: The code does not validate the input host header before using it directly in the `self.a.get()` method. This can lead to potential security risks such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior if the input is not sanitized properly. It is recommended to validate and sanitize the input before using it in the code.

4. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: 30
   Reason: The code does not handle the case where the host header is not found in the virtual host map properly. It directly raises an error without proper error handling which can lead to information disclosure or unexpected behavior. It is recommended to handle such cases gracefully and provide appropriate error messages.","CVE: CVE-2022-39348
CVE Description: Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function, it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure File Handling:
     - Line 13: The code opens a file ""assets/custom.css"" for reading without validating the file path. An attacker could manipulate the file path to read sensitive files or directories on the system.
   - Hardcoded API Key:
     - Line 20: The code uses a hardcoded API key stored in the variable `my_api_key`, which can be easily extracted by an attacker by analyzing the code.
   - Insufficient Input Validation:
     - Line 34: The code asserts the type of `my_api_key` to be a string, but this does not provide sufficient validation for the API key input.
   - Potential Command Injection:
     - Line 191: The code uses the `os.system` function to execute shell commands based on user input, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
3. Reason: The code contains multiple security vulnerabilities as mentioned above.
4. Recommendation: Implement secure file handling practices, avoid hardcoding sensitive information, perform proper input validation, and avoid executing shell commands based on user input to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-34094

205_test_ecrecover.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `test_invalid_signature` function, there is a vulnerability related to the `ecrecover` function call. The vulnerable line is:
     ```python
     return ecrecover(hash, v, r, s)
     ```
     Reason: The `ecrecover` function requires four arguments (hash, v, r, s) to recover the address from a signature. However, in this case, the `s` value is being read from a nested mapping `self.dummies[msg.sender][msg.sender]`, which may not provide a valid signature component. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

3. The `test_ecrecover_test` function does not contain any vulnerabilities.

4. Not applicable.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `cnnct` method at line 45. The code constructs the request payload with the username and password in plain text, which can be intercepted and used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Dremio server.
   - SQL Injection vulnerability in the `n_qry` method at line 63. The code directly inserts the `qry` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
   - Lack of input validation in the `gt_clmns` method at line 123. The `tbl_nm` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior or SQL Injection if not properly sanitized.
