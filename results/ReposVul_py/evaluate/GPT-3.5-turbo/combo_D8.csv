No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

     ```python
     disk_api._join_and_check_path_within_fs(getPath(), getUnsafePath())
     ```
     Reason: The function `test_check_unsafe_path` is testing the `_join_and_check_path_within_fs` function with a path that contains directory traversal (`etc/../../../something.conf`). This can allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside the intended directory structure.

   - Path Traversal vulnerability in the function `test_inject_files_with_bad_path` in the `TestVirtDisk` class at line 101. The vulnerable line is:
     ```python
     disk_api._inject_file_into_fs('/tmp', getInjectedFilePath(), getContent())
     ```
     Reason: The function `test_inject_files_with_bad_path` is testing the `_inject_file_into_fs` function with a path that contains directory traversal (`/etc/../../../../etc/passwd`). This can allow an attacker to overwrite or inject files outside the intended directory.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   Vulnerable Lines: Line 24
   Reason: The `_b` function does not validate the input `request.path` before using it in the conditional statement, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 46
   Reason: The `_d` function logs exceptions using the `logger` without providing detailed error information, which may make it harder to diagnose and fix issues in production.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of CSRF Protection
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 33
   Reason: The code does not include any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms, which can make the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Sanitization
   Vulnerable Lines: Line 35
   Reason: The code does not sanitize the input `response.headers['Content-Type']` before checking its value, which can lead to content spoofing or other security risks.

8. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure Communication
   Vulnerable Lines: N/A
   Reason: The code does not handle secure communication (e.g., HTTPS) explicitly, which can expose sensitive data to interception or tampering in transit.","CVE: CVE-2021-21354

CVE Description: Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Prior to versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds avaialble.

In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability:
     - Vulnerable lines: 97
     - Reason: The `eval` function is used in the `parse_header` method to dynamically execute code based on the input data. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input data is controlled by an attacker.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using `eval` function with untrusted input data to prevent code injection vulnerabilities. Consider using safer alternatives like parsing the input data in a more controlled manner.

4. Overall, the code is vulnerable to insecure deserialization due to the usage of the `eval` function.","CVE: CVE-2019-16785
CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - SQL Injection in the `get_group` function at line 53:
     The `where_clause` variable is constructed using string concatenation, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can manipulate the `group_name` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.
   - Insecure Direct Object References in the `post_group` function at line 77:
     The code does not properly validate the ownership of the group before allowing modifications. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `group_name` parameter to access or modify groups they are not authorized to.
   - Lack of Input Validation in the `post_group` function at line 77:
     The code does not validate the `userids` input received in the POST and PUT requests. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the input is not properly sanitized.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure File Upload: The code is vulnerable to insecure file upload as it does not perform proper validation on the uploaded image files. Specifically, the code does not check for the content type of the uploaded file, allowing potentially malicious files to be uploaded.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       - `def check_image_file_format(self, f):` at line 86
       - `def check_image_file_size(self, f):` at line 104
       - `def check_image_pixel_size(self, f):` at line 118
     - Reason: The code only checks the file extension, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker. It does not verify the actual content type of the file, which can lead to various security risks such as uploading malicious files or bypassing file restrictions.

3. Recommendation: Implement additional checks to verify the content type of the uploaded files to prevent malicious file uploads. Consider using a library or tool that can accurately determine the file type based on its content.

4. Note: The code has other functionalities related to image processing and validation, but the main security concern lies in the lack of content type validation for uploaded files.","CVE: CVE-2023-28837
CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: Dispatch is an open source security incident management tool. The server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message when the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin encounters an error when attempting to decode a JWT token. Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs. If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file. This issue has been addressed in commit `b1942a4319` which has been included in the `20230817` release. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE Description: flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```python
       def do_runcmd(self, arg):
           logging.info(""Running command using runcmd in shell"")
           os.system(arg)
       ```
     - Reason: The `os.system()` function in the `do_runcmd` method allows for command injection vulnerability as it executes the `arg` parameter directly without proper validation or sanitization.

   - Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```python
       elif username == cred.loginname and pwdreshash == cred.loginpass:
           print(lang.SUCCESSFUL_LOGIN)
           logging.debug('Correct login credentials, logged in')
           actualsys()
       ```
     - Reason: The code reveals sensitive information by printing the `lang.SUCCESSFUL_LOGIN` message which confirms successful login, potentially leaking valid credentials to an attacker.

3. Reason for vulnerability: 
   The code lacks input validation and sanitization, allowing for command injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, it exposes sensitive information through printed messages.

4. Recommendation:
   - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
   - Avoid printing sensitive information such as login success messages to prevent information disclosure.
   - Consider using safer alternatives to `os.system()` for executing commands.","CVE: CVE-2022-46179
CVE Description: LiuOS is a small Python project meant to imitate the functions of a regular operating system. Version 0.1.0 and prior of LiuOS allow an attacker to set the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable to anything other than null or true and skip authentication checks. This issue is patched in the latest commit (c658b4f3e57258acf5f6207a90c2f2169698ae22) by requiring the var to be set to true, causing a test script to run instead of being able to login. A potential workaround is to check for the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable and set it to """" (no quotes) to null the variable and force credential checks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `generate` method, the function `getChoice` uses the `secrets.choice` function to select a random character from the given set of characters. However, the `secrets.choice` function is not suitable for generating secure random passwords as it is not cryptographically secure. It is recommended to use `secrets.token_urlsafe` or `secrets.token_hex` for generating secure random passwords. (Line: 18)
   - In the `strengthcheck` method, the URL for the API request is constructed by concatenating user input (`query_char`) directly into the URL string. This can lead to potential URL manipulation attacks or injection attacks. It is recommended to validate and sanitize user input before using it in constructing URLs. (Line: 53)
   - In the `strengthcheck` method, the `createStrengthMessage` function constructs messages based on the password strength check results. However, the messages are not securely constructed and may expose sensitive information about the password strength. It is recommended to provide generic messages without revealing specific details about the password strength. (Line: 57)
   - In the `quickgenerate` method, the `generatePassword` function generates passwords using only alphanumeric characters. This may result in weak passwords that lack special characters or symbols, reducing the overall password strength. It is recommended to include a broader range of characters in password generation for better security. (Line: 107)

3. Reason for vulnerability:
   - The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure random password generation, URL manipulation, insecure message construction, and weak password generation practices.

4. Recommendation:
   - Use cryptographically secure methods for random password generation.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Storage:
     - Vulnerable lines: 50, 72, 94, 116, 138
     - Reason: The code stores passwords using a custom hashing scheme `pbkdf2_sha256`, but it also allows storing plain passwords in the database. Storing plain passwords is a security risk as it exposes user passwords in case of a data breach. All passwords should be securely hashed using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.

3. Recommendation:
   - Ensure that all passwords are securely hashed using a strong and adaptive hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 before storing them in the database.
   - Avoid storing plain passwords or using custom hashing schemes for password storage.

   - The code implements password hashing with PBKDF2, but it also allows storing plain passwords directly. It's crucial to consistently hash passwords and avoid storing them in plain text to enhance security.","CVE: CVE-2023-41885
CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

Similarly, the `connection_args_example` dictionary at line 131 contains example connection data without proper validation.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities that could lead to security risks such as unauthorized access and SQL injection attacks.

4. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation, parameterization for SQL queries, and secure handling of authentication tokens to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-38699
CVE Description: MindsDB's AI Virtual Database allows developers to connect any AI/ML model to any datasource. Prior to version 23.7.4.0, a call to requests with `verify=False` disables SSL certificate checks. This rule enforces always verifying SSL certificates for methods in the Requests library. In version 23.7.4.0, certificates are validated by default, which is the desired behavior.

CWE Description: 
",2.0,912.0,7.0,2.71490216255188
208_test_structure_exception.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy Vulnerability
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       @external
       @nonreentrant(""B"")
       @nonreentrant(""C"")
       def double_nonreentrant():
           pass
       ```
     - Reason: The function `double_nonreentrant` is marked as nonreentrant with conflicting nonreentrant keys ""B"" and ""C"", which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Exception Handling
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       @external
       def foo():
           throe
       ```
     - Reason: Typo in the code, `throe` should be `throw` for proper exception handling.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Variable Assignment
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       @external
       def foo():
           true: int128 = 3
       ```
     - Reason: Incorrect variable assignment, `true` is a reserved keyword in Python and should not be used as a variable name.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Variable Declaration
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       n: HashMap[uint256, bool][3]
       ```
     - Reason: Incorrect variable declaration, the syntax for declaring a mapping is incorrect.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Variable Declaration
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       a: constant(uint256) = 3
       n: public(HashMap[uint256, uint256][a])
       ```
     - Reason: Incorrect variable declaration, using a variable `a` to define the size of a mapping is not allowed.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Variable Declaration
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       a: immutable(uint256)
       n: public(HashMap[uint256, bool][a])

       @external
       def __init__():
           a = 3
       ```
     - Reason: Incorrect variable declaration, redefining `a` inside the `__init__` function.

   - Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Variable Assignment
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```
       m1: HashMap[uint8, uint8]

       @external
       def __init__():
           self.m1 = 234
       ```
     - Reason: Incorrect variable assignment, assigning an integer value to a mapping variable.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Starting in version 0.2.9 and prior to version 0.3.10, locks of the type `@nonreentrant("""")` or `@nonreentrant('')` do not produce reentrancy checks at runtime. This issue is fixed in version 0.3.10. As a workaround, ensure the lock name is a non-empty string.

CVE Description: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. Prior to version 3.8.0, the default email for initial user admin is `admin[@]mycompany[.]com`, and users reset their passwords by sending an email. Currently, the domain `mycompany.com` has not been registered. However, if it is registered in the future, it may affect the password reset functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.8.0 by changing the default email domain to `example.com`. Those who cannot upgrade may change the default email domain to `example.com` manually.
