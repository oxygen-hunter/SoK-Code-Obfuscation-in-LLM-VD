CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

     disk_api._join_and_check_path_within_fs, '/foo', 'etc/../../../something.conf'
     ```
     Reason: The method `disk_api._join_and_check_path_within_fs` does not properly validate the path, allowing directory traversal attacks.

   - Path Traversal vulnerability in the `test_inject_files_with_bad_path` method of the `TestVirtDisk` class at line 51. The vulnerable line is:
     ```python
     disk_api._inject_file_into_fs, '/tmp', '/etc/../../../../etc/passwd', 'hax'
     ```
     Reason: The method `disk_api._inject_file_into_fs` does not properly sanitize the file path, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directory.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization in the `disk_api._join_and_check_path_within_fs` and `disk_api._inject_file_into_fs` methods to prevent directory traversal attacks.

4. Note:
   - The code does not handle any input validation for paths in the mentioned methods, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.","CVE: CVE-2012-3361

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

1. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Information Leakage
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 68
   - **Reason:** The error message in the `oauth_callback` function directly displays the error parameter from the request args without proper sanitization. This can potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as the error message is not properly escaped.

2. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Input Validation
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 77
   - **Reason:** The code does not validate the `code` parameter obtained from the request args before using it to fetch the access token. This can lead to potential security issues if the `code` is manipulated or tampered with.

3. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Error Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 86
   - **Reason:** The code does not handle the case where the response from fetching the user profile is not successful (status code other than 200). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

4. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Authorization
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 94
   - **Reason:** The code does not perform any authorization checks before fetching the user profile using the access token. This can lead to unauthorized access to user profiles.

5. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Communication
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 101
   - **Reason:** The code makes a request to the profile URL without verifying the SSL certificate. This can expose the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

6. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Error Logging
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 108
   - **Reason:** The code does not log the error details properly when authentication fails. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues and identify potential security threats.

7. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of CSRF Protection
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 33
   - **Reason:** The `login` function does not include any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms. This can make the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

8. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Session Management
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 36
   - **Reason:** Storing the `next` URL in the `flask_session` without proper validation or expiration can lead to session fixation attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive URLs.

9. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Redirect
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 45
   - **Reason:** The `redirect` function in the `login` function does not validate or sanitize the `oauth_url` before redirecting. This can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities.

10. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Configuration
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 20-29
    - **Reason:** The OAuth configuration parameters (client_id, client_secret, etc.) are stored in the code directly, which can expose sensitive information. It is recommended to store such sensitive information securely, such as using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.

11. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Proper Exception Handling
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 99
    - **Reason:** The code catches a generic `Exception` in the `login_user` function, which can hide specific errors and make it difficult to identify and handle exceptions properly.

12. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Rate Limiting
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 99
    - **Reason:** The `login_user` function does not implement rate limiting for user login attempts. This can make the application vulnerable to brute force attacks.

13. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Proper Logging
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 101, 108
    - **Reason:** The code does not log sufficient details during the OAuth authentication process, which can make it challenging to track and investigate security incidents.

14. **Vulnerable: YES**
    - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Secure Data Handling
    - **Vulnerable Lines:** 99
    - **Reason:** The `login_user` function does not securely handle user data, as it directly uses the username and email without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to data manipulation or injection attacks.

77_serializers.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Potential Code Injection Vulnerability:
     - Vulnerable lines: `get_serializer` function
     - Reason: The `get_serializer` function takes input from the user in the form of headers and directly uses it to access dictionaries `SERIALIZER_NAMES` and `SERIALIZER_TYPES` without proper input validation. This can potentially lead to code injection attacks if an attacker manipulates the headers to access unintended serializers.

3. Recommendation:
   - Validate and sanitize the input headers before using them to access dictionaries to prevent code injection vulnerabilities. Implement strict input validation to ensure that only expected values are used to access the serializers.

4. Note:
   - The code imports external libraries like `msgpack` and `cbor2` which may introduce additional security risks if these libraries have known vulnerabilities. Make sure to keep these libraries updated to their latest secure versions.","CVE: CVE-2022-35411

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2).

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register.

       - Reason: The `log_fp` variable is constructed using user-controlled input `flagging_dir` without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
       - Vulnerable Line: `with open(log_fp, ""r"") as csvfile:`
       - Reason: The code reads the content of the log file without proper access control or authentication, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.
     - Vulnerability Type: Encryption Weakness
       - Vulnerable Line: `with open(log_fp, ""wb"") as csvfile:`
       - Reason: The code encrypts the log file using a potentially insecure method, which can lead to encryption weaknesses and compromise the confidentiality of the data.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to command injection, information disclosure, and encryption weaknesses that need to be addressed to improve security.

4. Note: Further analysis may be required to identify additional vulnerabilities or confirm the severity of the existing ones.","CVE: CVE-2022-24770
CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `generate` method, the condition `if lowercase and uppercase == True:` is incorrect. It should be `if lowercase is True and uppercase is True:` to check both conditions separately.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `PasseoPassword = ''.join(secrets.choice(password) for i in range(length))` is vulnerable because `secrets.choice` expects a sequence, but `password` is a string. It should be `PasseoPassword = ''.join(secrets.choice(password) for i in range(length))`.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `elif y == None:` will never be reached because `requests.get` will either return a response object or raise an exception. So, the condition should be removed.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `elif length == None:` will never be reached because the length of a string will always be an integer. So, the condition should be removed.
   - In the `generate` method, the conditions `if password.lower():`, `elif password.upper():`, and `elif password.lower() and password.upper():` are incorrect for checking if a password contains lowercase or uppercase letters. It should be `if password.islower():`, `elif password.isupper():`, and `elif password.islower() and password.isupper():` respectively.
   - In the `generate` method, the line `return str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Pwned']) + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Length'] + '\n' + str(StrengthCheckQuiz['Case']) + '\n' + 'The Passeo password strength test has ended. Any questions/bugs? Raise a issue on https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/issue.')` is vulnerable because of the incorrect concatenation of strings.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

CVE Description: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. Prior to version 3.8.0, the default email for initial user admin is `admin[@]mycompany[.]com`, and users reset their passwords by sending an email. Currently, the domain `mycompany.com` has not been registered. However, if it is registered in the future, it may affect the password reset functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.8.0 by changing the default email domain to `example.com`. Those who cannot upgrade may change the default email domain to `example.com` manually.
