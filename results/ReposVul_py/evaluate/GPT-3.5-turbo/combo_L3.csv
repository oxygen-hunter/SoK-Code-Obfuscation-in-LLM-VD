CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

CVE Description: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.
 This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.

This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

CVE Description: Querybook is an open source data querying UI. In affected versions user provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. This may allow attackers to perform reflected cross site scripting (XSS) if Content Security Policy (CSP) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version 3.14.2 or greater). Users unable to upgrade may enable CSP and not allow unsafe-inline or manually escape query parameters in a reverse proxy.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Missing Indentation: Line 6 is missing proper indentation.
   - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The `obj_id` parameter in the `delete` method of `DeleteAggregateAction` class is directly used without proper validation, which can lead to IDOR vulnerability.
   - Missing Input Validation: The `filter_string` parameter in the `filter` methods of `AggregateFilterAction` and `AvailabilityZoneFilterAction` classes is directly used without proper input validation, which can lead to various vulnerabilities like Injection attacks.
   - Insecure Deserialization: The `aggregate.metadata.iteritems()` method in the `get_metadata` function uses `iteritems()` which can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `safe_unordered_list` function does not properly escape the input value, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

3. Exploitation:
   - The missing indentation can lead to syntax errors and make the code difficult to read and maintain.
   - The IDOR vulnerability can allow unauthorized access to resources.
   - Missing input validation can lead to various security risks like Injection attacks.
   - Insecure deserialization can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.
   - XSS vulnerability can allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.

4. Recommendation:
   - Properly indent the code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Implement proper input validation to prevent Injection attacks.
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.
   - Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `iteritems()`.
   - Use proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2014-125070

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness (Line 17): The `random.randint` function is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. It is recommended to use `secrets` module for generating secure random numbers.
   - Exception Handling (Line 33): The generic exception handling in the `create_ticket` method can hide potential errors and make it difficult to troubleshoot issues. It is better to handle specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 33): The `create_ticket` method does not validate the input parameters, such as `category_channel` and `default_message_ticket_channel`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
   - Lack of Permission Check (Line 52): The `update_ticket` method does not check if the user has the necessary permissions before updating the ticket information, which can lead to unauthorized modifications.
   - Lack of Permission Check (Line 67): The `close_ticket` method does not properly check if the user has the required role to manage tickets before closing the ticket, which can lead to unauthorized access.
   - Lack of Permission Check (Line 78): The `purge_tickets` method does not verify if the bot has the necessary permissions to delete channels, which can result in the bot failing to delete closed tickets.
   - Lack of Permission Check (Line 94): The `automatic_setup` method does not check if the bot has the required permissions to create categories, roles, and set permissions, which can lead to setup failures.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `StripCommentsFilter` class, the `_get_insert_token` method uses a regular expression to search for a newline character at the end of the token value. This regex operation can be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks if the input is controlled by an attacker. The vulnerable line is:
     ```python
     m=re.search(r'((\r|\n)+) *$',token.value)
     ```
     Reason: The regular expression pattern `((\r|\n)+) *$` can be manipulated by an attacker to cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to a DoS condition.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The regular expression used in the `_get_insert_token` method is not anchored or limited in terms of input size, making it susceptible to ReDoS attacks.

4. Note: Other parts of the code should also be reviewed for potential security vulnerabilities, but the identified ReDoS vulnerability is the most critical in the provided code snippet.","CVE: CVE-2021-32839

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Logging (Line 26, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82): The code uses logging to output potentially sensitive information such as keys, signatures, and server names. This can lead to information disclosure if the logs are not properly secured.
   - Malformed Authorization Header (Line 86): The `parse_auth_header` function does not handle exceptions properly, which can lead to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack by raising an exception for every malformed Authorization header.
   - Missing Authorization Headers Check (Line 90): The code does not check if the Authorization headers are missing before processing them, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
   - Missing Signature Verification (Line 98): If no matching signature is found, the code raises a `SignatureVerifyException` without handling it properly, potentially leaking information about the verification process.

3. Recommendation:
   - Ensure that sensitive information is not logged in production environments.
   - Implement proper exception handling in the `parse_auth_header` function to prevent DoS attacks.
   - Check for the presence of Authorization headers before processing them to avoid unexpected behavior.

CVE Description: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

2. Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary File Upload
   Vulnerable Lines:  def to_python(self, data): and self.check_image_file_format(self, f)
   Reason: The code allows users to upload any file type by not properly validating the file content. The function `to_python` does not check the actual content of the file to ensure it is an image file. The function `check_image_file_format` only checks the file extension, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

3. The code is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload attacks due to insufficient file content validation.","CVE: CVE-2023-28837
CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

2. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Line: `parser.add_argument('input', default='-', help='input filename or URL')`
   Reason: The 'input' argument is directly used without any validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized.

3. Vulnerability Type: XXE (XML External Entity) Injection
   Vulnerable Line: `parser.add_argument('-u', '--unsafe', action='store_true', help='fetch external files, resolve XML entities and allow very large files (WARNING: vulnerable to XXE attacks and various DoS)')`
   Reason: Enabling the 'unsafe' option allows fetching external files and resolving XML entities, which can lead to XXE attacks if not properly handled.

4. Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal
   Vulnerable Line: `else: kwargs['url'] = options.input`
   Reason: The 'url' parameter is directly assigned from user input 'options.input' without proper validation, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

5. Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
   Vulnerable Line: `output_format = (options.format or os.path.splitext(options.output)[1].lstrip('.') or 'pdf').upper()`
   Reason: The 'output_format' is derived from user input 'options.format' and 'options.output' without proper validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

6. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Line: `parser.add_argument('--output', default='-', help='output filename')`
   Reason: The default value for the 'output' argument is set to '-', which can potentially lead to information disclosure if sensitive data is written to stdout unexpectedly.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Line: `SURFACES[output_format.upper()].convert(**kwargs)`
   Reason: The input parameters passed to the 'convert' method are not properly validated, which can lead to various security vulnerabilities depending on how the method processes the input.

8. Vulnerability Type: Import Injection
   Vulnerable Line: `from . import SURFACES, VERSION`
   Reason: The use of relative imports (starting with '.') can lead to import injection vulnerabilities if the import path can be controlled by an attacker.

9. Vulnerability Type: Unsafe File Operations
   Vulnerable Line: `kwargs['write_to'] = (stdout.buffer if options.output == '-' else options.output)`
   Reason: Directly writing to the output file specified by the user without proper validation can lead to unsafe file operations and potential file overwriting or arbitrary file writes.

10. Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Input Sanitization
    Vulnerable Line: `kwargs['file_obj'] = stdin.buffer`
    Reason: The 'file_obj' parameter is directly assigned from user input 'stdin.buffer' without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

11. Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Output Sanitization
    Vulnerable Line: `kwargs['write_to'] = (stdout.buffer if options.output == '-' else options.output)`
    Reason: The 'write_to' parameter is assigned based on user input 'options.output' without proper output sanitization, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if the output is not properly handled.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness: The `generate` method uses the `secrets.choice` function to generate a password. However, the way the password is generated is not secure. The `password` variable is concatenated with characters based on the conditions, which can lead to weak passwords. It is recommended to use a secure random password generator to ensure strong password generation.
   - Incorrect Password Strength Check: The `strengthcheck` method has incorrect logic for checking the password strength. The conditions for checking the password length and case are not implemented correctly. The `if password.lower():` and `if password.upper():` conditions will always evaluate to `True` as they are checking the truthiness of the strings, not the presence of lowercase or uppercase characters in the password. This can lead to incorrect assessment of password strength.
   - Lack of Input Sanitization: The code does not perform input validation or sanitization. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior when processing user input.

CVE Description: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

   - Validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in the code to prevent code injection attacks. Use whitelisting or input validation techniques to ensure that the inputs are safe and within the expected range.

4. Note: The code should implement proper input validation and sanitization to mitigate the code injection vulnerability.","CVE: CVE-2023-3765
