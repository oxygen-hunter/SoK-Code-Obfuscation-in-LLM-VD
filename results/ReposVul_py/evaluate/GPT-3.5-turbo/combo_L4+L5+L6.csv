A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

     - Vulnerable Lines: 33
     - Reason: The `path_to_filesystem` function does not properly handle user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to perform path traversal attacks. An attacker could manipulate the input path to access files outside of the intended directory (`base_folder`), leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the system.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent path traversal attacks. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed characters and paths.

4. Additional Note:
   - The code also lacks input validation for the `base_folder` parameter, which could potentially introduce further vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

     ```
     Reason: The `exe` variable is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the command execution.

   - Command injection: The `_validateCmd` method in the `UdevRules` class does not properly validate the `cmd` parameter, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is present in the following lines:

4. Recommendation: Implement proper authorization checks, authentication mechanisms, and input validation to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-45809
CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE Description: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

   Vulnerable Lines: 23
   Reason: The code constructs a command using user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `options.input` variable is directly used in constructing the command without proper validation.

3. Vulnerability Type: XXE (XML External Entity) Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 33
   Reason: The code sets the `unsafe` flag based on user input without proper validation. Enabling the `unsafe` flag can lead to XXE attacks and various Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

4. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure

   Reason: The code imports modules using a relative import statement (`from . import SURFACES, VERSION`). This can introduce insecure dependencies and potential module hijacking attacks.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 23, 33, 35, 38
   Reason: The code lacks proper input validation for user-controlled inputs such as `options.input`, `options.unsafe`, `options.format`, and `options.output`. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities including command injection, XXE injection, information disclosure, and unvalidated redirect.

8. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Output Sanitization

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

CVE Description: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens. A fix is available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`. There are no known workarounds.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure file handling: The code does not handle file operations securely, such as closing files properly after opening them. This can lead to resource leaks and potential denial of service attacks.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       - Line 26: The `open` function in the `test_unclosed_file` test does not close the file after opening it.
       - Line 33: The `im.close()` call in the `test_closed_file` test is unnecessary and can lead to potential issues.
   - Lack of input validation: The code does not validate input files properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 51: The `invalid_file` variable in the `test_invalid_file` test is not validated before using it.
   - Lack of exception handling: The code does not handle exceptions properly, which can lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 59: The `FliImagePlugin.FliImageFile` call in the `test_invalid_file` test does not handle exceptions gracefully.
   - Lack of secure coding practices: The code lacks secure coding practices, such as validating user inputs and handling resources properly.
     - Vulnerable lines:
       - Line 26: The `open` function in the `test_unclosed_file` test does not handle resources securely.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure file handling, lack of input validation, lack of exception handling, and lack of secure coding practices.

4. Recommendation: Implement secure file handling practices, validate input files before using them, handle exceptions gracefully, and follow secure coding practices to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2021-28676

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Debug Messages: The code contains debug messages that reveal sensitive information such as encryption keys or data. This can lead to information disclosure if the debug messages are enabled in a production environment.
     - Vulnerable lines: Line 97, Line 101
     - Reason: Debug messages should not expose sensitive information in a production environment as it can be exploited by attackers.

3. Insecure Data Parsing: The code uses `ast.literal_eval` to parse the `tpm_policy` and `vtpm_policy` from agent data. This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized properly.
     - Vulnerable lines: Line 94
     - Reason: Using `ast.literal_eval` can execute arbitrary code if the input is not validated, leading to code injection attacks.

4. Insecure Deserialization: The code uses `json.loads` to deserialize the `allowlist` and `mb_refstate` from agent data. This can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities if the input is not validated properly.
     - Vulnerable lines: Line 126, Line 134
     - Reason: Deserializing untrusted JSON data can lead to security risks such as code execution or denial of service attacks.

5. Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform sufficient input validation on the `agent_data` before processing it. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks or data manipulation.
     - Vulnerable lines: Line 186
     - Reason: Input validation is essential to ensure that the data being processed is safe and does not contain malicious content.

6. Lack of Error Handling: The code lacks proper error handling in some parts, which can result in unexpected behavior or crashes when exceptions occur.
     - Vulnerable lines: Line 126, Line 134
     - Reason: Proper error handling is necessary to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent the application from crashing or exposing sensitive information.","CVE: CVE-2022-23949

2. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 162
   Reason: The `_find_subcommand` method in the `JupyterApp` class constructs a command by directly concatenating the `self.name` and `name` variables without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the `name` parameter, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 116, 120
   Reason: The `load_config_file` method in the `JupyterApp` class logs sensitive information such as file paths and exceptions at DEBUG level. This can potentially leak sensitive information to an attacker if the logging level is misconfigured.

4. Vulnerability Type: Insecure File Permissions
   Vulnerable Lines: 77, 81
   Reason: The `data_dir` and `runtime_dir` properties in the `JupyterApp` class create directories with insecure permissions (0o700) without considering the potential risks. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of critical files by other users on the system.

5. Vulnerability Type: Input Validation
   Vulnerable Lines: 134-143
   Reason: The `write_default_config` method in the `JupyterApp` class uses the `input` function to interact with the user without validating or sanitizing the input. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform unexpected actions or bypass security controls.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Randomness (Line 19): The `secrets.choice()` function is used to generate random characters for the password. However, the randomness may not be cryptographically secure due to the way it is implemented. It is recommended to use a more secure random number generator like `secrets.token_urlsafe()` for generating passwords.
   - Insecure Password Storage (Line 29): The generated passwords are stored in a plaintext file 'passeo_passwords.txt' without any encryption or hashing. Storing passwords in plaintext is a security risk as it exposes the passwords to potential attackers. It is recommended to store passwords securely using techniques like hashing with salt.
   - Insecure API Request (Line 36): The code makes a request to 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' to check if the password has been pwned. However, the request is made over HTTP without any encryption (HTTPS). This can expose sensitive information to eavesdroppers. It is recommended to use HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Incorrect Password Strength Check (Line 45-71): The password strength check implementation is incorrect. It checks for lowercase and uppercase letters separately, which may lead to false positives or negatives. It is recommended to revise the password strength check logic to ensure accurate results.

     - Vulnerable lines: 13-24
     - Reason: The custom `is_equal` function implemented in case the `compare_digest` function is not available is vulnerable to timing attacks. The custom implementation does not have constant-time comparison, which can leak information about the password during the comparison process.

3. The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the insecure comparison implementation in the custom `is_equal` function.

CVE Description: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 38, 70, 89, 97, 105, 123, 131
     - Reason: The code uses a custom password hashing scheme (`pbkdf2_sha256`) which is not recommended. It's better to use a well-established and secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Additionally, the code does not enforce strong password policies such as complexity requirements (e.g., special characters, numbers) or password expiration.

3. Recommendation:
   - Replace the custom password hashing scheme with a secure and well-tested algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
   - Implement strong password policies to ensure that users choose secure passwords.
   - Consider implementing password expiration and rotation policies to enhance security.

4. Note:
   - The codebase seems to have a good structure and uses type hints effectively, but the custom password hashing implementation is a critical security concern that should be addressed.","CVE: CVE-2023-41885
CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

   - Insecure JWT Decoding (Line 96):
     The code uses `jwt.decode` with the option `verify_signature` set to `False`, which disables the signature verification of the JWT token. This can lead to security vulnerabilities as the token's integrity is not verified.

   - Insufficient Exception Handling (Line 45, 63, 85, 107, 123):
     The code uses broad exception handling without specifying the exact exceptions to catch. This can mask errors and make it difficult to identify specific issues.

   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 39, 61, 83, 105):
     The code does not perform sufficient input validation on user-provided data before processing it. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure JWT decoding, insufficient exception handling, and lack of input validation.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

   - Using assert statement for input validation (Line 24): The assert statement is typically used for debugging purposes and should not be used for input validation in production code. It can be disabled at runtime, leading to potential security risks.
   - Using user input directly in SQL queries or API calls (No direct evidence in the provided code, but potential risk in functions like `get_model`): If the `user_api_key` variable is obtained from user input and used in sensitive operations like API calls or database queries without proper validation, it can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or API abuse.
