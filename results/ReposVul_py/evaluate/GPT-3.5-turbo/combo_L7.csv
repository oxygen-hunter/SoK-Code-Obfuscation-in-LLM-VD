A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

   - **Reason:** The `random_string` function in the C code does not check if the `length` parameter exceeds the `MAX_STRING_LENGTH`, which can lead to a buffer overflow if a large value is passed.

2. **Vulnerable:** NO
   - **Reason:** The `is_plural` function in the C code correctly handles the input and does not contain any security vulnerabilities.

#### Solidity Code:
1. **Vulnerable:** YES
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Code Injection
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** 
     ```solidity
     mstore(result, script)
     ```
   - **Reason:** The `eval_js` function in the Solidity code directly stores the `script` parameter in memory without any validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

### Overall Analysis:
- The Python code is not vulnerable to any security issues.
- The C code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `random_string` function.
- The Solidity code is vulnerable to code injection in the `eval_js` function.

It is important to address the vulnerabilities identified in the C and Solidity code to ensure the security of the applications using these components.","CVE: CVE-2023-0297

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 97-101
     - Reason: The `chpasswd` function handles password changes by directly calling the system's `libc` library with the `setpass` function. This is a security vulnerability as it involves inline assembly code which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges. This can lead to a potential code injection attack.

3. Recommendation:
   - Avoid using inline assembly code in Python as it can introduce security vulnerabilities. Instead, use secure and standard methods provided by the Python standard library or third-party libraries to handle password changes securely.

   Reason: The line `asm volatile ("""" : ""+r"" (request));` is attempting to use inline assembly code to obscure the `request` object. This is a dangerous practice as it introduces the risk of code injection vulnerabilities. Inline assembly code should be avoided in Python code as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and security risks.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Sanitization

CVE Description: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.

   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `DeviceListView` class:
     - Vulnerable lines: `return TOTPDevice.objects.devices_for_user(self.kwargs['user_id'], confirmed=True)`
     - Reason: The code directly uses the `user_id` from the URL parameters without proper authorization checks, which can lead to an IDOR vulnerability where an attacker can access other users' devices by manipulating the `user_id` parameter in the URL.

   - Insufficient Authorization in `DeviceDeleteView` class:

2. Vulnerability Type: Insecure File Operations
   Vulnerable Lines: 30, 31, 39, 40
   Reason: The code uses insecure file operations without proper validation or sanitization. Specifically, it reads private key and certificate files and CA certificate files without checking for potential directory traversal attacks or other file system vulnerabilities. This can lead to arbitrary file read vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   Vulnerable Lines: 33, 41
   Reason: The code lacks proper error handling for file operations. If the file opening or reading operations fail, exceptions are caught but the errors are not properly handled or logged, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

4. Vulnerability Type: Use of Inline Assembly
   Vulnerable Lines: 67-77

CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

   Reason: The code is using `typeid` to check the type of the input parameter, which is incorrect. `typeid` is used for identifying the dynamic type of an object at runtime, not for checking the type of a variable. This can lead to incorrect type checking and potential vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Type: Insecure regex patterns
   Vulnerable Lines: 10, 17
   Reason: The regex patterns used for validating email and link are not comprehensive and may lead to false positives or negatives. It's recommended to use more robust regex patterns for email and URL validation to prevent bypassing the validation.

4. NOT SURE
   Reason: The code is using C-style strings for email and link inputs in the `validate_email_asm` and `validate_link_asm` functions, which may lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input strings are not properly null-terminated. It's recommended to use `std::string` for input parameters to avoid such vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-45813
CVE Description: Torbot is an open source tor network intelligence tool. In affected versions the `torbot.modules.validators.validate_link function` uses the python-validators URL validation regex. This particular regular expression has an exponential complexity which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using a well-crafted argument. An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability in the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system. The validators file has been removed in version 4.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

     - Reason: The code creates a socket file at `_SOCKET_PATH` with insecure permissions. It checks if the directory exists and if the socket file exists, but it does not ensure that the socket file has secure permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of the socket file by other users.

   - Use of Inline Assembly:
     - Line: 53
     - Reason: The code uses inline assembly in C style which can introduce security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, code injection, and other memory-related issues. This can lead to potential security risks in the application.

   - Lack of Input Validation:
     - Line: 108
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input `revocation_cert_path` in the `await_notifications` function. This can lead to path traversal attacks or other security issues if the input is controlled by an attacker.

3. Recommendation:
   - Ensure that the socket file created at `_SOCKET_PATH` has secure permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Avoid using inline assembly in C style as it can introduce security vulnerabilities. Consider using safer alternatives.

CVE Description: `gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.

CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

   - Lack of input validation: The code does not properly validate user input in the `generate_page` function. The `valid_param` function does not handle all possible edge cases and may lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Specifically, the function `valid_param` only checks if the alphanumeric version of the input matches the alphanumeric version of the keys in the dictionary. This can be exploited by an attacker to bypass input validation.
   - Lack of exception handling: The code lacks proper exception handling in the `generate_page` function. The generic `except` block catches all exceptions, making it difficult to identify and handle specific errors. This can lead to unhandled exceptions and potential security vulnerabilities.
   - Lack of CSRF protection: The code does not include CSRF protection for form submissions. This can make the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Hashing Algorithm:
     - Vulnerable lines: 50, 78
     - Reason: The code uses a custom hashing function `_hash_with_asm` which loads a shared object file `hashlib.so` and calls a C function `pbkdf2_sha256` for hashing passwords. This implementation is not recommended as it introduces potential security risks due to the complexity and lack of transparency in the custom hashing algorithm. It's better to use standard and well-tested cryptographic libraries like hashlib for secure password hashing.

3. Recommendation:
   - Replace the custom hashing function `_hash_with_asm` with a standard cryptographic hashing algorithm like PBKDF2 or bcrypt provided by Python's hashlib library for secure password hashing.
   - Avoid custom implementations of cryptographic functions as they can introduce vulnerabilities and weaken the security of the application.","CVE: CVE-2023-41885
CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.
