CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

     - Reason: The code directly uses the `pk` value from the request parameters `object_id` and `session_user[""id""]` to query the database without proper authorization checks. This can lead to an Insecure Direct Object References vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the `object_id` or `session_user[""id""]` to access unauthorized user accounts.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that the current user has the necessary permissions to access the target user account before performing any actions.
   - Avoid using direct object references from user inputs without proper validation and authorization checks.

4. Note:
   - The code also imports `ctypes` and loads a C library which may introduce additional security risks if the C library is not secure or if there are vulnerabilities in the way it is used. Further review of the C library and its interactions with the Python code is recommended.","CVE: CVE-2021-46898

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cookie Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 20, 24
     - Reason: The code uses the `get_secure_cookie` method to retrieve the user ID from the cookie, but it compares the result with an empty string `''` instead of `None`. This can lead to incorrect authentication logic as an empty string may not represent an anonymous user. Additionally, the `clear_login_cookie` method clears the cookie without proper validation.
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:
     - Vulnerable lines: 78, 86
     - Reason: The code dynamically generates the `cookie_name` using user input (`self.request.host`) without proper sanitization. This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if an attacker manipulates the `host` header to inject malicious content into the cookie name.
   - Lack of Input Validation:
     - Vulnerable lines: 126, 134, 142
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input received in the `get_json_body` method before parsing it as JSON. This can lead to potential security risks such as deserialization attacks or unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
   - Insufficient Error Handling:

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `sign_out` function at line 77. The `client_id` parameter is directly concatenated into the redirect URL without proper validation or encoding, which can lead to potential IDOR attacks.
   - Lack of input validation in the `sign_in_callback` function at line 49. The `state` parameter is not properly validated against potential CSRF attacks. The comparison `if state != request.cookies.get('python-flask-csrf')` is not sufficient to prevent CSRF attacks.
   - Lack of proper error handling in the `sign_in_callback` function at line 49. The exception raised for a possible CSRF attack does not handle the error gracefully and can potentially leak sensitive information.
   - Lack of secure communication in the `fetch_user_info` function at line 71. The access token is sent in the header without proper encryption or secure communication, which can lead to token leakage.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

2. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   - Vulnerable Line: `c_lib = CDLL('./c_utils.so')`
   - Reason: The code dynamically loads a shared library (`c_utils.so`) using a relative path. An attacker could manipulate the current working directory or place a malicious shared library with the same name in a directory where the Python process has permissions, leading to arbitrary code execution.

3. Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal
   - Vulnerable Line: `upload_path = request.values[input_upload_path]`
   - Reason: The code directly uses user-controlled input (`upload_path`) to extract files without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the `upload_path` to perform path traversal attacks and overwrite arbitrary files on the system.

4. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   - Vulnerable Line: `c_lib.validate_archive_name.argtypes = [c_char_p, c_char_p]`
   - Reason: The code exposes the argument types of the `validate_archive_name` function, potentially leaking information about the function's signature to an attacker.

5. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
   - Vulnerable Line: `if not len(exts):`
   - Reason: The code checks for valid file extensions based on the `upload_name` provided by the user without proper input validation. An attacker could bypass this check by manipulating the filename.

6. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Error Handling
   - Vulnerable Line: `with zipfile.ZipFile(path, ""r"") as zip:`
   - Reason: The code lacks proper error handling during the extraction of zip files. If an error occurs during the extraction process, it may lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.

7. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure Coding Practices
   - Vulnerable Line: `if os.path.isdir(target_path):`
   - Reason: The code directly checks if a directory exists without considering potential symbolic link attacks or race conditions, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

8. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure File Operations
   - Vulnerable Line: `shutil.rmtree(target_path)`
   - Reason: The code uses `shutil.rmtree` to recursively delete a directory without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the `target_path` to delete unintended files or directories.

9. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Secure Communication
   - Vulnerable Line: `request.values[input_upload_name]`
   - Reason: The code retrieves user-controlled data from the request without ensuring secure communication channels, potentially exposing sensitive information during file uploads.

10. Vulnerability Type: Lack of Exception Handling
    - Vulnerable Line: `except Exception:`
    - Reason: The code uses a broad exception handling mechanism, catching all exceptions without specific error handling, which can mask underlying issues and make debugging and security analysis challenging.","CVE: CVE-2022-3607

In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 148-166:
     The code allows non-legit requests attempting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by constructing URLs with arbitrary hosts. This can lead to security risks such as accessing internal resources or performing unauthorized actions.
     Vulnerable lines: 156, 162
     Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, allowing attackers to manipulate the URL and potentially access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code does not properly validate user-controlled input when constructing URLs, which can lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.

CVE Description: Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

2. Vulnerability Type: Insecure Library Usage
   Vulnerable Lines: 42, 44
   Reason: The code imports and uses the `ctypes` library to load a shared library (`c_library.dll`) without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the shared library is malicious or tampered with.

3. Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   Vulnerable Lines: 94
   Reason: The `Truncator` class has a `MAX_LENGTH_HTML` attribute set to a large value (5,000,000), which could potentially lead to denial of service attacks by consuming excessive memory when processing large HTML content.

4. Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 126
   Reason: The `_get_random_filename` function generates a random filename using `secrets.randbelow` without proper input validation. If `max_random_bytes` is controlled by user input, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

5. Vulnerability Type: Untrusted Input
   Vulnerable Lines: 134
   Reason: The `compress_string` function accepts `max_random_bytes` as a parameter, which could be controlled by user input. This can lead to potential security risks if untrusted input is used to manipulate the compression process.

6. Vulnerability Type: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
   Vulnerable Lines: 172
   Reason: The `smart_split_re` regular expression pattern used in the `smart_split` function is susceptible to ReDoS attacks due to excessive backtracking caused by nested quantifiers and alternations. This can lead to denial of service by consuming high CPU resources for certain inputs.","CVE: CVE-2023-43665

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):
     - Vulnerable lines: 77, 78
     - Reason: The code does not properly validate the requested path in the `list_wiki` function. An attacker could manipulate the `folderpath` parameter to access files outside the intended directory (`cfg.wiki_directory`), leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files.

   - Command Injection:
     - Vulnerable lines: 94
     - Reason: The `os.walk` function in the `search` function is vulnerable to command injection due to the unsanitized input `cfg.wiki_directory`. An attacker could manipulate the `cfg.wiki_directory` path to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
     - Vulnerable lines: 116, 123
     - Reason: The code does not properly sanitize user input before rendering it in the HTML response. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the rendered HTML, leading to XSS attacks.

   - Password Management:
     - Vulnerable lines: 198
     - Reason: Storing passwords in SHA-256 hash format without salting is not secure. It is recommended to use a strong hashing algorithm with salt for password storage.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure URL concatenation: 
     - Vulnerable lines: 8-14
     - Reason: The code constructs the URL by concatenating query parameters directly into the URL string. This can lead to URL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

   - Lack of input validation:
     - Vulnerable lines: 8-14
     - Reason: The code does not validate or sanitize the input parameters before constructing the URL, which can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks.

   - Lack of error handling for SSL errors:
     - Vulnerable lines: 41
     - Reason: The code catches SSL errors but returns a generic error response without specific handling for SSL-related issues, which can make it difficult to diagnose and mitigate SSL errors.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization for constructing URLs to prevent URL injection vulnerabilities.
   - Add specific error handling for SSL errors to provide more detailed and actionable responses in case of SSL-related issues.

4. Note:
   - The code imports modules that are not used in the provided snippet (e.g., `ssl`, `ctypes`). It's important to review the entire codebase to ensure that all imported modules are necessary for the functionality and remove any unused imports to reduce potential attack surface.","CVE: CVE-2022-3500

       ```python
       def do_runcmd(self, arg):
           O.system(arg)
       ```
     - Reason: The `arg` parameter is directly passed to the `O.system()` function, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

   - Vulnerability Type: Hardcoded Credentials
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
       ```python
       elif username == Cr.loginname and pwdreshash == Cr.loginpass:
       ```
     - Reason: The code compares the input username and hashed password directly with hardcoded values from the `cred.py` file, which is a security risk as the credentials are hardcoded in the source code.

3. Reason for Vulnerability: 
   - The code allows command injection through the `do_runcmd` method by directly passing user input to the `O.system()` function without proper validation.
   - The code uses hardcoded credentials for authentication, which is a security risk as sensitive information is exposed in the source code.

4. Recommendation:
   - Sanitize user input in the `do_runcmd` method to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
   - Avoid using hardcoded credentials in the code and implement secure authentication mechanisms such as password hashing and salting.","CVE: CVE-2022-46179

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Logging: The code uses the `RotatingFileHandler` to log messages to a file named 'poems.log'. Storing sensitive information like logs in a file can lead to information disclosure if the log file is not properly secured. An attacker could potentially access this file and gain insights into the application's behavior or sensitive data.
     - Vulnerable lines: `handler = RotatingFileHandler('poems.log', maxBytes=10000, backupCount=1)`
     - Reason: Storing logs in a file without proper access controls can expose sensitive information.

   - Lack of Input Validation: The code lacks proper input validation in the `generate_page` function. The `valid_param` function does not validate the input parameters thoroughly, which could lead to various security issues such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```python
       if alphanum(param) == alphanum(k):
       ```
     - Reason: The input parameters are not sanitized or validated properly before being used in comparisons.

   - Lack of Error Handling: The code lacks proper error handling in the `generate_page` function. The exception handling block does not provide detailed error messages or handle exceptions gracefully, which could lead to potential information leakage or application instability.

   - Vulnerable Line: `return hashlib.calculate_hash(b'5a5b6e17f9c34025a75b052fc06c50ab').decode('utf-8')`
   - Reason: The input value `b'5a5b6e17f9c34025a75b052fc06c50ab'` is hardcoded in the code, which means the hash calculation is always done for the same fixed input. This is not a good practice for hashing as it should be done on user-provided or dynamic data.

CVE Description: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Line 77, Line 123):
     The code uses a custom hashing scheme for password storage, which is not recommended. It is better to use standard cryptographic hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for securely storing passwords. Custom cryptographic implementations are prone to vulnerabilities and should be avoided.

   - Use of ctypes with external shared library (Line 34):
     The code uses ctypes to load and call functions from an external shared library ('salt_generator.so'). This can introduce security risks if the shared library is not properly validated or if there are vulnerabilities in the library code. It is recommended to avoid using ctypes with external shared libraries for security reasons.

3. Reason for vulnerability:
   - The custom password hashing scheme used in the code is not as secure as standard cryptographic hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2. Custom cryptographic implementations are more prone to vulnerabilities and should be avoided in favor of well-established solutions.
   - Using ctypes with external shared libraries can introduce security risks due to potential vulnerabilities in the shared library code or improper validation of the library. It is recommended to use safer alternatives for interacting with external code.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization
     - Vulnerable lines: lib.contents.restype = c_char_p, lib.where.restype = c_char_p
     - Reason: The code uses the `c_char_p` type for the return type of functions `lib.contents` and `lib.where`. This can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the returned data is not properly validated and sanitized before being decoded as UTF-8. Attackers could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.

3. Recommendation:
   - Ensure proper input validation and sanitization of data returned by `lib.contents` and `lib.where` functions before decoding as UTF-8 to mitigate the risk of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-37920

205_test_ecrecover.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `test_invalid_signature` function, the `test_ecrecover` function is vulnerable to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation for the `s` parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `s` parameter to cause the function to run indefinitely, consuming excessive gas and leading to a DoS attack.
   - The vulnerable line is: `s: uint256 = self.dummies[msg.sender][msg.sender]`
   - Reason: The `s` parameter is directly retrieved from the `dummies` mapping without any validation or bounds checking, allowing an attacker to manipulate the value of `s` to trigger a DoS attack.

3. The `test_ecrecover_test` function does not contain any vulnerabilities.

4. The code snippet provided is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to the lack of input validation in the `test_ecrecover` function.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.

207_dremio_handler.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the `connect` method at line 59. The code constructs the data payload for the Dremio login request using the username and password directly from the `connection_data` dictionary without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `connection_data` dictionary to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or sensitive information.
   - Lack of input validation in the `native_query` method at line 85. The code directly constructs the SQL query string using the input `query` without proper sanitization, which could lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.
   - Lack of proper error handling in the `native_query` method at line 85. The code catches exceptions but does not provide detailed error messages or log the errors securely, which could potentially leak sensitive information or make it easier for attackers to exploit the system.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities related to insecure data handling and lack of input validation.

4. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation, parameterized queries, and secure error handling to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-38699
