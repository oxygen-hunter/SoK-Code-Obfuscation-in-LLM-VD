2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Logging (Line 44, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100): The code uses the `logger.warn` method to log potentially sensitive information such as file paths, certificate information, and custom CA cert file usage. This can lead to information disclosure if an attacker gains access to the logs.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 34, 40): The code reads and loads a private key and certificate file without validating the input. This can lead to path traversal attacks or loading malicious files.
   - Lack of Error Handling (Line 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100): The code does not handle exceptions properly when reading files or loading certificates, which can result in uncaught exceptions and potential application crashes.
   - Lack of HTTPS Security Best Practices (Line 34, 40, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100): The code does not enforce secure HTTPS practices such as certificate validation, certificate pinning, or secure cipher suites, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
   - Lack of Content Size Validation (Line 118): The code does not properly validate the size of incoming HTTP request content, which can lead to denial of service attacks by sending large payloads.

3. Reason: The code contains multiple security vulnerabilities including insecure logging, lack of input validation, lack of error handling, lack of HTTPS security best practices, and lack of content size validation.

4. Recommendation: Implement secure logging practices, validate input data, handle errors gracefully, enforce HTTPS best practices, and validate incoming content sizes to improve the security of the code.","CVE: CVE-2021-29430
CVE Description: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available.

CVE Description: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.

27_basic_ldap.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure LDAP Authentication: The code uses LDAP authentication without securely handling the user credentials. The user's password is sent in plaintext to the LDAP server, which can be intercepted by an attacker. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
     - Vulnerable lines: 
       ```python
       ldap_connection.simple_bind_s(userdn, password)
       ```
     - Reason: The user's password should be securely hashed and transmitted over a secure channel (e.g., TLS) to prevent interception by malicious actors.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement secure password handling mechanisms such as hashing and salting user passwords before transmitting them.
   - Use secure communication channels like TLS/SSL for transmitting sensitive information like passwords.
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.

4. Note:
   - Ensure to follow LDAP best practices and security guidelines to protect user credentials and prevent unauthorized access.","CVE: CVE-2020-26214
CVE Description: In Alerta before version 8.1.0, users may be able to bypass LDAP authentication if they provide an empty password when Alerta server is configure to use LDAP as the authorization provider. Only deployments where LDAP servers are configured to allow unauthenticated authentication mechanism for anonymous authorization are affected. A fix has been implemented in version 8.1.0 that returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized response for any authentication attempts where the password field is empty. As a workaround LDAP administrators can disallow unauthenticated bind requests by clients.

       self.db = loop.run_until_complete(self.dbw.cursor())

     - Reason: The code uses `loop.run_until_complete` to create a database connection and cursor synchronously, which can lead to blocking the event loop and potential race conditions in a multi-threaded environment. It's recommended to use asynchronous methods for database operations to avoid race conditions.

3. Recommendation: Refactor the code to use asynchronous database operations instead of synchronous ones to prevent race conditions and improve performance.","CVE: CVE-2020-26236
CVE Description: In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.

In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE Description: Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

",2.0,876.0,7.0,1.3011348247528076
93_tests.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not. Tell me YES or NO.

YES

2. List of vulnerabilities type, vulnerable lines, and the reason:

- **Information Disclosure**: The code reveals sensitive information such as user agents, IP addresses, and session keys in various places. For example, in the `ViewsTest` class, the session key is exposed in the URL when deleting a session (`test_delete` method) and when deleting another session (`test_delete_some_other` method). This can potentially lead to session hijacking or unauthorized access if an attacker gains access to these details.

- **Session Management**: The code does not implement proper session management practices. For instance, in the `SessionStoreTest` class, the `test_duplicate_create` method does not handle the case of creating duplicate session keys securely. This can lead to session fixation attacks.

- **Command Injection**: The `call_command` function is used in the `ClearsessionsCommandTest` and `MigratesessionsCommandTest` classes without proper input validation. This can potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not sanitized.

3. Reason for the vulnerabilities:

- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information like session keys, user agents, and IP addresses are exposed in the code, making it easier for attackers to exploit these details for malicious purposes.

- **Session Management**: Inadequate handling of session creation and duplication can lead to security risks such as session fixation attacks, where an attacker can set a user's session ID to a known value and hijack their session.

- **Command Injection**: The use of `call_command` without proper input validation can allow attackers to inject malicious commands and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

4. Recommendation:

- Implement proper session management practices, such as generating unique and secure session keys, handling session creation securely, and avoiding session fixation vulnerabilities.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information like session keys, user agents, and IP addresses in URLs or responses.
- Sanitize input when using functions like `call_command` to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2020-5224
CVE Description: In Django User Sessions (django-user-sessions) before 1.7.1, the views provided allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.

CVE Description: tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

CVE Description: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

   - Command Injection: The code is vulnerable to command injection due to the use of user input in the `os.path.splitext` function. This can lead to arbitrary command execution.
     - Vulnerable lines: `os.path.splitext(options.output)[1].lstrip('.')`
     - Reason: User input `options.output` is directly used in the `os.path.splitext` function without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the command and execute arbitrary commands.
   - XXE (XML External Entity) Injection: The code is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to the use of the `--unsafe` flag which allows fetching external files and resolving XML entities.
     - Vulnerable lines: `parser.add_argument('--unsafe', action='store_true', ...)`
     - Reason: Enabling the `--unsafe` flag can lead to XXE attacks where an attacker can exploit the XML parsing functionality to read sensitive files or perform denial of service attacks.
3. Recommendation: Validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in functions like `os.path.splitext` to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Avoid enabling unsafe options like `--unsafe` to mitigate XXE vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-27586
CVE Description: CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo, a 2D graphics library. Prior to version 2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing SVG files. A malicious actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows them to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0 disables CairoSVG's ability to access other files online by default.

CVE Description: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Deserialization:
     - Line 47: The code uses `dumps` from `bson.json_util` to serialize the data. This can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the data is deserialized in an unsafe manner. Attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
   - Lack of Input Validation:
     - Multiple routes (e.g., `/v1/create_product`, `/v1/update_product`, `/v1/delete_product`, `/v1/user`, `/v1/give_product`, `/v1/revoke_product`, `/v1/create_purchase`) do not perform proper input validation on the incoming JSON data. This can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks, data manipulation, etc.
   - Lack of Error Handling:
     - In routes like `/v1/create_product`, `/v1/update_product`, `/v1/delete_product`, `/v1/user`, `/v1/give_product`, `/v1/revoke_product`, `/v1/create_purchase`, generic exceptions are caught without specific error handling. This can make it difficult to identify and respond to errors appropriately.
   - Hardcoded Secret:
     - Line 94: The code uses a hardcoded secret key (`"".ROBLOSECURITY"": config[""roblox""][""cookie""]`) for authentication. Hardcoding secrets in the code can expose them to unauthorized access.

   - Type: CSV Injection
   - Vulnerable lines: 20, 26
   - Reason: The code is vulnerable to CSV Injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of exported data. The `export_resource` method does not properly escape or sanitize the data before exporting, which can lead to malicious formula injection when the exported data is opened in a spreadsheet application.

3. Recommendations:
   - Implement proper sanitization techniques to prevent CSV Injection vulnerabilities. Consider using libraries or built-in functions that handle CSV data safely, such as the `csv` module in Python.
   - Validate and sanitize the data before exporting to ensure that it does not contain any malicious content that could be executed as a formula in a spreadsheet application.","CVE: CVE-2022-2111

CVE Description: openssh_key_parser is an open source Python package providing utilities to parse and pack OpenSSH private and public key files. In versions prior to 0.0.6 if a field of a key is shorter than it is declared to be, the parser raises an error with a message containing the raw field value. An attacker able to modify the declared length of a key's sensitive field can thus expose the raw value of that field. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.0.6, which no longer includes the raw field value in the error message. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

CVE Description: Dispatch is an open source security incident management tool. The server response includes the JWT Secret Key used for signing JWT tokens in error message when the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin encounters an error when attempting to decode a JWT token. Any Dispatch users who own their instance and rely on the `Dispatch Plugin - Basic Authentication Provider` plugin for authentication may be impacted, allowing for any account to be taken over within their own instance. This could be done by using the secret to sign attacker crafted JWTs. If you think that you may be impacted, we strongly suggest you to rotate the secret stored in the `DISPATCH_JWT_SECRET` envvar in the `.env` file. This issue has been addressed in commit `b1942a4319` which has been included in the `20230817` release. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE Description: flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.

CVE Description: Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

Version 0.1.0 and prior of LiuOS allow an attacker to set the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable to anything other than null or true and skip authentication checks. This issue is patched in the latest commit (c658b4f3e57258acf5f6207a90c2f2169698ae22) by requiring the var to be set to true, causing a test script to run instead of being able to login. A potential workaround is to check for the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable and set it to """" (no quotes) to null the variable and force credential checks.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `generate` function, the condition `if lowercase and uppercase == True` is vulnerable to logical error. It should be `if lowercase is True and uppercase is True`. This vulnerability is on line 15. The reason is that the current condition will always evaluate to `False` due to the incorrect logical operator.
   - In the `strengthcheck` function, the conditions `if password.lower()` and `elif password.upper()` are vulnerable to logical errors. These conditions will not work as intended to check if the password contains lowercase or uppercase letters. This vulnerability is on lines 47 and 55. The reason is that the conditions are not correctly checking the presence of lowercase or uppercase letters in the password.

3. Recommendation:
   - Update the conditions in the `generate` function to `if lowercase is True and uppercase is True`.
   - Update the conditions in the `strengthcheck` function to properly check for lowercase and uppercase letters in the password.

CVE Description: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE Description: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

205_test_ecrecover.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `test_invalid_signature` function, the code is vulnerable to a Reentrancy attack due to the use of `ecrecover` function with an invalid `v` value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
   - Vulnerable lines: 
     - Line 15: `return ecrecover(hash, v, r, s)`
     - Line 26: `assert c.test_ecrecover(hash_, v, r) is None`
   - Reason: The `v` value used in the `ecrecover` function is set to 0, which is an invalid value. This can cause the `ecrecover` precompile to not write to the output buffer as expected, potentially leading to unexpected results.

3. Recommendation: Ensure that valid and secure parameters are used when calling sensitive functions like `ecrecover` to prevent vulnerabilities like Reentrancy attacks.

4. Note: The `test_ecrecover_test` function does not contain any vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-37902
CVE Description: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.

207_dremio_handler.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure handling of sensitive data: The code contains sensitive information such as username and password stored in plain text within the code. Storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text is a security risk as it can be easily exposed if the code is compromised.

   - Lack of input validation: The code does not perform input validation on the connection_data parameters received in the DremioHandler class. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.

   - Lack of secure communication: The code sends sensitive information (username and password) over HTTP without encryption. This can expose the credentials to eavesdropping attacks.

3. Vulnerable lines:
   - Line 38: Storing sensitive information (username and password) in plain text.
   - Line 67: Sending credentials over HTTP without encryption.

4. Reason for vulnerability:
   - Storing sensitive information in plain text can lead to exposure if the code is compromised.
   - Sending credentials over HTTP without encryption can expose the credentials to eavesdropping attacks.","CVE: CVE-2023-38699
