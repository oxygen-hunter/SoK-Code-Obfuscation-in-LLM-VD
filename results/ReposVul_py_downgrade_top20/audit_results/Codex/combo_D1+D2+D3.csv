2. - Authentication bypass (`data\ReposVul_py\combo_C1\63_auth.py:33` and `data\ReposVul_py\combo_C1\63_auth.py:35`): when the configuration sets `auth_type` to `""None""`, `NoneAuth.is_authenticated()` returns `True` for every credential pair, so anyone can log in without a password.  
   - Arbitrary code execution via unsafe dynamic import (`data\ReposVul_py\combo_C1\63_auth.py:17`): `import_module(auth_type).Auth` loads whichever module name the configuration supplies; if an attacker can influence this value and get a module they control onto the Python path, its import-time code runs with full privileges.  
   - Authentication denial-of-service / broken SSHA verification (`data\ReposVul_py\combo_C1\63_auth.py:98`–`data\ReposVul_py\combo_C1\63_auth.py:107`): after decoding the SSHA blob, the code overwrites `hash_value` with only the first 20 bytes and then tries to derive the salt from that truncated value, leaving the salt empty. Legitimate SSHA hashes therefore never validate, so selecting the SSHA scheme locks out every user.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES  
2. - Type: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF); Lines: `RecursiveUrlLoader._get_child_links_recursive` (`requests.get`) and `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive` (`session.get`)—roughly lines 87 and 149; Reason: the loader accepts attacker-controlled URLs and blindly follows redirects without any allowlist, IP, or scheme validation, so a malicious user can pivot the crawler to hit internal services or metadata endpoints.  
   - Type: Insecure TLS Configuration; Lines: `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive` (`aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`)—roughly line 141; Reason: explicitly disabling certificate verification lets any forged certificate succeed, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS targets.

  2. This module is a Django unit-test suite that only exercises existing proxy/download safeguards; it doesn’t implement  
     production request processing or trust user-controlled data, so it doesn’t expose any exploitable behavior.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES
2. - Denial of Service (memory exhaustion) – `binary_server.py:21` – `self.messages = asyncio.Queue()` leaves the queue unbounded; the code enqueues every client message with `put_nowait`, so a fast or malicious client can outrun `_process_received_message_loop`, forcing the process to accumulate unbounded state and exhaust memory.
- Denial of Service (memory exhaustion) – `binary_server.py:52`, `binary_server.py:63` – `data_received` trusts `header.body_size` from the peer and keeps appending into `self._buffer` until that size is met; a crafted header with an enormous body length makes the server buffer attacker-controlled data indefinitely, leading to memory exhaustion.

2. - Vulnerability: CSV/Formula Injection; Location: `InvenTreeResource.py:14`; Reason: Uses `type(val) is str`, so any Django string subclasses (`SafeString`, `Promise`, etc.) skip sanitization, letting attacker-controlled values starting with `=`/`+`/`-`/`@` persist and execute as formulas when the CSV is opened.
   - Vulnerability: CSV/Formula Injection; Location: `InvenTreeResource.py:12`; Reason: `illegal_start_vals` stores the literal sequences `'\\t'`, `'\\r'`, `'\\n'` instead of actual control characters, so real tab/carriage-return/newline prefixes are never stripped and can be abused for Excel macro injection.
   - Vulnerability: Denial of Service; Location: `InvenTreeResource.py:16`; Reason: The index expression `(999-900)/99+0*250` evaluates to `1.0` in Python 3, causing `val[1.0]` to raise `TypeError`. Any multi-character value therefore crashes the export, letting an attacker force export failures and disrupt availability.
