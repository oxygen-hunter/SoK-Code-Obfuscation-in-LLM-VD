63_auth.py,"1. YES  
2. - Type: Dynamic Code Execution (Code Injection); Lines: code.py:16; Reason: Unvalidated configuration value `auth_type` is passed straight into `import_module`, letting an attacker who can influence configuration import arbitrary modules and run their top-level code (including malicious `Auth` classes).  
   - Type: Authentication Bypass; Lines: code.py:11-17 and code.py:46-48; Reason: Choosing the built-in `""None""` auth type gives `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated` always returns `True`, so anyone controlling (or tampering with) the configuration can bypass authentication altogether.  
   - Type: Insecure Password Storage; Lines: code.py:82-83; Reason: The `""plain""` backend stores and verifies passwords in clear text, so compromise of the htpasswd file immediately exposes raw credentials.  
   - Type: Weak Password Hashing; Lines: code.py:86-101; Reason: The `""sha1""` path uses unsalted SHA-1 (easy to brute-force), and the `""ssha""` path mishandles the decoded value so the salt is discarded (`hash_value = hash_value[:20]` before extracting `salt_value`), effectively downgrading SSHA to unsalted SHA-1 and defeating the expected protection of salted hashes.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES
2. - Improper TLS certificate validation (`RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive`, line 178): the async code creates `aiohttp.ClientSession` with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, which turns off HTTPS certificate verification and leaves every async fetch vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and forged responses.

133_tests.py,"
1. NO
  2. combo_D8/133_tests.py is a Django unit-test module that only exercises existing proxy/download controls; it never     
     ships in production or processes user input outside the test harness, so it doesn’t introduce any exploitable         
     behavior.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES
2. - Denial of Service (resource exhaustion): `binary_server.py:21` and `binary_server.py:47` create and use an unbounded `asyncio.Queue`; a client that floods messages faster than `_process_received_message_loop` can drain them causes the queue and process memory to grow without limit until the worker or host crashes.  
   - Denial of Service (memory exhaustion via oversized messages): `binary_server.py:77`-`binary_server.py:95` trust `header.body_size` without any sanity limit; an attacker can advertise an enormous body, stream data until the buffer reaches that size, and exhaust memory before the message is processed.

2. - Vulnerability Type: CSV Formula Injection (Spreadsheet Formula Injection)  
     - Lines: `get_illegal_start_vals` (`code snippet` line `return ['@', '=', '+', '-', '@', '\\t', '\\r', '\\n']`)  
     - Reason: The list uses the literal strings `'\\t'`, `'\\r'`, and `'\\n'` instead of the actual control characters `'\t'`, `'\r'`, `'\n'`. As a result, values beginning with a real tab/newline survive the sanitization loop, allowing attackers to craft cells like `'\t=HYPERLINK(...)'` that Excel will still evaluate, enabling formula injection.
