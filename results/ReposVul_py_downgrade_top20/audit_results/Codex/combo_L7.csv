2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Type: Arbitrary code execution (CWE-94) at `snippet.py:17`. The `load` function blindly passes the configuration-provided `auth_type` into `import_module(auth_type)`, so a malicious configuration can point to any module (including one they ship) and run attacker-controlled code during authentication setup.  
- Type: Authentication bypass (CWE-306) at `snippet.py:12-29`. Selecting the `""None""` auth type instantiates `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated` method always returns `True`, so anyone can log in if they can influence the auth configuration.  
- Type: Plaintext password storage option (CWE-256) at `snippet.py:67-68`. When `htpasswd_encryption` is set to `""plain""`, the verifier compares raw strings, meaning the credential file must store cleartext passwords—compromise of that file exposes every password immediately.

- Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) — `recursive_url_loader.py:153` — The async loader creates `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, globally disabling TLS certificate verification. Any HTTPS fetch done through this path will accept attacker-supplied certificates, enabling man-in-the-middle interception or content tampering.

     ships as production logic or handles live user input, so it introduces no exploitable vulnerability.

2. - `Denial of Service` — `provided_code.py:62-65` — A partial TCP frame that doesn’t contain the full OPC UA header raises `NotEnoughData`; the handler immediately closes the transport instead of buffering and waiting for the rest of the header. Legitimate clients whose headers are split across packets will be dropped, and attackers can trivially keep the server busy by drip-feeding incomplete headers.  
   - `Denial of Service (memory exhaustion)` — `provided_code.py:22`, `provided_code.py:70-75` — Incoming messages are queued on an unbounded `asyncio.Queue` and `_buffer` accepts any `header.body_size` without validation. A client that sends well-formed messages faster than they are processed, or advertises/sends extremely large bodies, can force the server to retain arbitrarily large amounts of data in memory.

2. - Vulnerability Type: CSV / Formula Injection; Vulnerable Lines: `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` lines 10-46; Reason: attacker-controlled strings are only trimmed (`val = val.strip()`) and neither the `illegal_start_vals` list nor the attempted inline assembly actually remove leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, etc., so malicious formulas (e.g., `=HYPERLINK(...)`) are exported unchanged and will execute when the CSV is opened in spreadsheet software.
