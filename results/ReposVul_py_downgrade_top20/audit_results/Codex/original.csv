63_auth.py,"YES  
- Vulnerability type: Missing authentication (CWE-306); location: `NoneAuth.is_authenticated` in the presented snippet around class definition (≈lines 48-52); reason: the method unconditionally returns `True`, so selecting the `""None""` auth type disables authentication entirely and exposes all resources without credentials.  
- Vulnerability type: Use of insecure cryptographic algorithms (CWE-327); location: `Auth.__init__` branches enabling `self._plain`, `self._sha1`, `self._ssha`, `self._crypt`, and `self._md5apr1` (≈lines 69-110); reason: these code paths accept plaintext, unsalted SHA-1, salted SHA-1, legacy `crypt`, and MD5-APR1 hashes respectively—each of these schemes is cryptographically weak today, allowing attackers to recover or brute-force credentials if such options are configured.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"
1. YES
      - Insecure transport (TLS): original/132_recursive_url_loader.py:220-228 disables SSL verification by creating       
        aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False) “because websites may have invalid certificates.” This forces every async crawl to 
        skip certificate validation, so any active or passive MITM attacker can intercept and tamper with HTTPS responses, 
        defeating confidentiality/integrity of fetched data and enabling response injection.

133_tests.py,"
1. NO
  2. original/133_tests.py is a Django test suite that only exercises proxy/download behaviour; it runs solely in the      
     testing context, doesn’t process production traffic, and therefore doesn’t introduce an exploitable vulnerability.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"YES  
- **DoS: unbounded message queue** – `binary_server.py:24` (`self.messages = asyncio.Queue()`) and `binary_server.py:63` (`self.messages.put_nowait(...)`) create a queue with infinite capacity. A client that sends messages faster than `_process_received_message_loop` can drain them will grow the queue without backpressure, exhausting memory and crashing the service.  
- **DoS: unbounded message/body buffering** – `binary_server.py:41` (`self._buffer += data`) plus the absence of any size checks before accepting `header.body_size` in `binary_server.py:55` let a client advertise and deliver arbitrarily large message bodies. The server accumulates the full payload in RAM before slicing it out, enabling trivial memory-exhaustion attacks.

165_admin.py,"YES  
- CSV/Formula Injection — `export_resource` (likely `admin.py`: line with `if type(val) is str`) — The sanitization only runs for values whose exact type is `str`. Django fields can return `SafeString` (and other `str` subclasses) containing user-controlled data. Because the strict type check skips subclasses, an attacker can supply a `SafeString` beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`, which keeps the dangerous leading character and reintroduces a spreadsheet-formula injection vector.
