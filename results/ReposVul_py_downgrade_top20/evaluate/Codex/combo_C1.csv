2. - Remote Code Execution (`load`:16): `import_module(auth_type).Auth` instantiates whatever module name the config provides; if an attacker can influence the config, they can load a malicious module whose import-time code executes.
   - Authentication Bypass (`NoneAuth.is_authenticated`:29-30): choosing `auth_type` of `""None""` activates `NoneAuth`, which unconditionally returns `True`, letting any credentials succeed whenever the config is tampered with.
   - Plaintext Password Handling (`Auth._plain`:75-76): the `""plain""` mode compares the supplied password to the stored value with no hashing, exposing raw credentials if the htpasswd file is read and enabling trivial compromise.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES  
2. - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – `RecursiveUrlLoader._get_child_links_recursive`:94 and `_async_get_child_links_recursive`:161; the loader issues outbound requests to whatever URL is supplied (including recursively discovered links) without any allowlist or scheme restrictions, letting an attacker pivot these calls toward internal-only services or metadata endpoints.  
   - TLS Certificate Verification Disabled – `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive`:153; the asynchronous client forces `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, so TLS certificates are never verified and the connection becomes vulnerable to man-in-the-middle tampering.

  2. The file is a Django test suite that only exercises and validates proxy and download protections; it does not         
     contain production request-handling logic or perform unsafe operations on user-controlled data, so no exploitable     
     vulnerability is introduced here.  
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES
2. - Denial of Service (unbounded queue growth) – `OPCUAProtocol.__init__`:21 and `OPCUAProtocol.data_received`:75. The per-connection `asyncio.Queue()` is created without a `maxsize`, and every parsed message is enqueued with `put_nowait`; a client can stream messages faster than they are processed, causing unbounded memory growth and service exhaustion.
   - Denial of Service (unbounded message buffering) – `OPCUAProtocol.data_received`:58-76. The server fully trusts the attacker-controlled `header.body_size` and keeps appending inbound bytes to `_buffer` until that size is reached, with no sanity limit; a client can advertise an enormous body size and force the server to accumulate arbitrarily large payloads in memory.
