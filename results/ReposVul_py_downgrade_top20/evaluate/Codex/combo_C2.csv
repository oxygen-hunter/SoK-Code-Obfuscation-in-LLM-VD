63_auth.py,"YES – the module contains security issues.

**Vulnerabilities**  
- `Code injection / RCE` — `provided_code.py:29` — `load()` imports `import_module(auth_type)` based solely on configuration input; if an attacker can control that setting, they can load any module on the Python path (including one they planted), execute its import-time code, and gain arbitrary code execution under the service account.  
- `Authentication DoS` — `provided_code.py:133` — `_ssha()` overwrites `hash_value` before extracting the salt (`salt_value = hash_value[20:]`), so the salt is always empty; any deployment that enables the SSHA option will reject every valid password, letting an attacker flip the configuration to “ssha” (or craft an SSHA entry) to lock out all users.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.
CWE: ['CWE-362']

",2.0,801.0,7.0,1.2434959411621094
132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES
2. Type: Insecure TLS configuration; Location: `data/ReposVul_py/original/132_recursive_url_loader.py:220-231`; Reason: the async crawler creates `aiohttp.ClientSession` with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, completely disabling certificate validation. Any attacker on the network path can present a forged certificate, intercept or modify the crawled content, and potentially steer the crawler to malicious follow-on targets, defeating HTTPS protections.

4. Not applicable (assessment certain).
","CVE: CVE-2023-46229
CVE Description: LangChain before 0.0.317 allows SSRF via document_loaders/recursive_url_loader.py because crawling can proceed from an external server to an internal server.

  2. This file contains only Django unit tests that exercise proxy and download protections; it doesn’t implement          
     production request handling or expose user-controlled data, so it doesn’t introduce exploitable behavior.  
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES
2. - Denial of Service (memory exhaustion) — `data\ReposVul_py\original\143_binary_server_asyncio.py:30`, `data\ReposVul_py\original\143_binary_server_asyncio.py:82`: The per-connection queue is created without a size limit and populated via `put_nowait` whenever data arrives. A client can flood the server with messages faster than `_process_received_message_loop` can drain them, forcing the process to retain every queued message body in memory and allowing a single connection to exhaust RAM and kill the service.
","CVE: CVE-2023-26151
CVE Description: Versions of the package asyncua before 0.9.96 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) such that an attacker can send a malformed packet and as a result, the server will enter into an infinite loop and consume excessive memory.

165_admin.py,"1. YES  
2. - Improper formula neutralization – `admin.py:20` – The check `if type(val) is str:` only sanitizes values that are exactly Python `str` objects. Django commonly hands back user-controlled data as subclasses such as `SafeString`, `Promise`, or other lazy translation types; those skip this branch entirely and keep the leading `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`, so a malicious input stored as one of those types still exports a live Excel formula.
