2. - Authentication Bypass — `load_vm` lines 55-59 and `NoneAuth.is_authenticated` line 82; selecting auth type “None” loads `NoneAuth`, which blindly returns `True`, so any actor who can flip `auth_type` (e.g., via a writable config) can disable authentication entirely.  
   - Remote Code Execution — `load_vm` line 67; the configuration-sourced `auth_type` is passed straight into `import_module`, so an attacker who can influence that setting (and drop/point to a module on the Python path) can cause their code to run during import or inside the attacker-supplied `Auth` class.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Type: Remote Code Execution — Vulnerable lines: `VM.run:56`, `VM.run:58` — Reason: The VM writes to and looks up functions in `globals()` based on instruction data. If an attacker controls the instruction stream, they can overwrite globals or invoke arbitrary callables, yielding full code execution.  
- Type: Improper Certificate Validation — Vulnerable line: `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive:125` — Reason: Creating `aiohttp.ClientSession` with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)` disables TLS verification, so HTTPS fetches can be intercepted or spoofed via MITM.  
- Type: Server-Side Request Forgery — Vulnerable lines: `RecursiveUrlLoader._get_child_links_recursive:105`, `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive:138` — Reason: Both code paths fetch a caller-supplied `url` with no scheme/host allowlist or other validation; an attacker can coerce the loader into reaching internal endpoints or cloud metadata services.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

**Security Findings**
- Remote Code Execution (`binary_server.py:19`, `binary_server.py:55`): `VM.load_program` accepts arbitrary instruction streams and `VM.run` dispatches them directly to `op_*` handlers; `op_CALL` then executes whatever callable the instruction embeds with attacker-controlled arguments. If an OPC UA client can influence the instruction sequence, it can `PUSH` any host callable (e.g., `os.system`) and trigger it via `CALL`, giving full code execution inside the server process.
- Denial of Service (`binary_server.py:37`, `binary_server.py:43`, `binary_server.py:48`, `binary_server.py:52`): Stack-manipulation ops (`op_POP`, `op_ADD`, `op_SUB`, `op_LOAD`, `op_STORE`) perform unchecked pops and indexed reads. A crafted instruction sequence can underflow or reference out-of-range entries, raising `IndexError`/`TypeError` and crashing the VM execution loop, letting a remote client kill the server process.
","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

2. - Denial of Service (Infinite Loop): `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` lines 65-67 call `preprocess_vm` defined at lines 49-62. For any string starting with one of the “illegal” characters, `preprocess_vm`’s VM jumps directly to `POP`, so it returns the original value unchanged. The `while` loop condition stays true forever, so a crafted value can hang the export and exhaust CPU.
