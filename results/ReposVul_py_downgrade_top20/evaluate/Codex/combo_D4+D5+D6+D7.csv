2. - Authentication bypass (`auth.py:12`, `auth.py:31-32`): choosing auth type `""None""` loads `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated` always returns `True`, so a mis-set or tampered config completely disables authentication.
   - Insecure credential storage (`auth.py:44-45`, `auth.py:68-69`): the `""plain""` backend just compares the supplied password to the file contents, forcing administrators to store passwords in clear text, leaking credentials if the file is read.
   - Weak password hashing (`auth.py:40-43`, `auth.py:74-79`, `auth.py:46-51`, `auth.py:94-95`, `auth.py:60-64`, `auth.py:71-72`): the supported `""sha1""`, `""md5""`, and `""crypt""` schemes rely on obsolete, fast hashes (SHA-1, MD5, DES-crypt) that are trivial to brute-force or collide, so captured hashes can be cracked quickly.
   - Arbitrary code execution via config (`auth.py:16-17`): loading an arbitrary module name from configuration and instantiating its `Auth` class lets anyone who can modify the config execute attacker-controlled Python code.

","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"YES  
- Type: Insecure TLS configuration (certificate verification disabled)  
  Vulnerable lines: `RecursiveUrlLoader._async_get_child_links_recursive`, `aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False), ...)` (around lines 95-102)  
  Reason: Setting `ssl=False` on the connector disables TLS certificate validation, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks or connection to spoofed endpoints whenever HTTPS URLs are fetched asynchronously.

  2. This file is a Django unit-test suite that simply exercises existing proxy/download protections; it doesn’t implement 
     application logic or trust user-controlled data, so it introduces no exploitable behavior.  
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES  
2. - DoS (memory exhaustion) — `binary_server.py:51-70`: `data_received` keeps extending `_d` and only slices it after an entire message (header + declared body length) is present; there is no cap on `header.body_size`, so a client can advertise an enormous size, stream data until the server holds it all in memory, and exhaust RAM.  
   - DoS (queue exhaustion) — `binary_server.py:21` and `binary_server.py:69-83`: inbound messages are enqueued onto an unbounded `asyncio.Queue`; a fast client can push many well-formed messages faster than `_process_received_message_loop` can consume them, causing unbounded growth in queued objects and memory use.
","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

2. CSV formula injection – `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` (`if type(v) is str:` line) – the code only sanitizes values whose exact type is `str`. Django often produces `SafeString`/`Promise` objects (subclasses of `str`), so attacker-controlled values such as `SafeString(""=cmd"")` bypass the check and remain in the export, letting spreadsheet formulas execute on open.
