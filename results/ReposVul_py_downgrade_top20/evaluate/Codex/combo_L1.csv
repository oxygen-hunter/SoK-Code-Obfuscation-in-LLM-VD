- Type: Arbitrary module import → possible remote code execution  
  Lines: `OX3E1B4E78`, line with `OX5C1F3A96 = import_module(OXA4C2D0E4).Auth`  
  Reason: The authentication “type” string is taken straight from configuration and passed to `import_module` without validation. If an attacker can influence that setting (or the config file), they can point it at any module on the Python path that exposes an `Auth` attribute, allowing execution of attacker‑controlled code during authentication.  
- Type: Plaintext credential handling  
  Lines: `OX7A2E0B9D.__init__` branch `elif self.OX7E1A3B9C == ""plain"":`, plus `OX3D9E7C2F`  
  Reason: Selecting the `plain` htpasswd method causes passwords to be stored and compared in clear text (`return OX8B4D1A6E == OX9B8E1D5C`). Anyone with read access to the htpasswd file can recover credentials instantly, violating basic password‑storage security expectations.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

2. - Vulnerability type: Improper TLS certificate validation (CWE-295); Vulnerable line: `data/ReposVul_py/combo_L1/132_recursive_url_loader.py:148`; Reason: the async branch builds `aiohttp.ClientSession` with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, explicitly disabling HTTPS certificate verification and exposing every fetch to MITM tampering.  
   - Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918); Vulnerable lines: `data/ReposVul_py/combo_L1/132_recursive_url_loader.py:95` and `data/ReposVul_py/combo_L1/132_recursive_url_loader.py:156`; Reason: the loader issues `requests.get(...)` / `session.get(...)` to whatever URL is supplied (and to any redirects it follows) without host allowlisting or scheme checks, enabling an attacker who controls the base URL to pivot the crawler toward internal or otherwise sensitive services.

     attack surface.   
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. - Denial of Service (memory exhaustion): `OX7E3F0A47.data_received` around lines 39‑55 trusts the client‑supplied `body_size` without any upper bound, so an attacker can announce an enormous payload and stream data until the process runs out of memory.  
   - Denial of Service (queue flood): `OX7E3F0A47.__init__` around lines 17‑22 creates `self.OX3F7B9D1E = asyncio.Queue()` without a `maxsize`, and `data_received` (lines 46‑48) uses `put_nowait`; a fast sender can overwhelm the unbounded queue faster than `_process_received_message` drains it, leading to uncontrolled memory growth.
