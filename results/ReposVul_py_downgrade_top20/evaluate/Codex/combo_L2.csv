2. - Code injection / Remote code execution – `snippet.py:17`: `import_module(auth_type).Auth` loads an arbitrary module name taken directly from configuration. If an attacker can influence that value or drop a module on the search path, they can trigger execution of attacker-controlled import-time code.  
   - Authentication bypass – `snippet.py:13-31`: selecting `""None""` as the auth type instantiates `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated` simply returns `True`, turning off authentication entirely whenever an attacker can modify the configuration.  
   - Weak password storage / offline cracking – `snippet.py:66-93`: supporting `""plain""` stores cleartext passwords, and both `""sha1""` and the broken `""ssha""` implementation operate without a salt. In `_ssha` the salt is discarded (`hash_value = hash_value[:20]` followed by `salt_value = hash_value[20:]`), so SSHA entries are effectively unsalted SHA-1 hashes, enabling efficient brute-force attacks if the password file leaks.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. YES
2. - `recursive_url_loader.py:153` — Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295). The async loader constructs `aiohttp.ClientSession` with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, which disables all TLS certificate checks; an attacker on the network can spoof HTTPS responses or perform man-in-the-middle attacks without detection.

1. NO
  2. combo_L2/133_tests.py is a Django unit-test module that merely exercises proxy/download behaviour inside the test     
     harness; it doesn’t ship to production or expose user-controlled data, so it introduces no exploitable vulnerability. 
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES  
2. - DoS (unbounded queue growth) — `binary_server.py:19`, `binary_server.py:67`, `binary_server.py:75`: The connection reader pushes every parsed message into an `asyncio.Queue()` created without a `maxsize`, so a fast client or many concurrent clients can enqueue messages faster than `_process_received_message_loop` consumes them, exhausting RAM.  
- DoS (unbounded message size) — `binary_server.py:47`, `binary_server.py:63`, `binary_server.py:67`: `data_received` trusts `header.body_size` entirely; there is no validation or cap before buffering the announced payload, so a remote peer can advertise and send extremely large bodies, forcing the server to accumulate them in `_buffer` and `Buffer`, leading to memory exhaustion.

- CSV formula injection; `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` (`code_snippet.py`:7-12): the code only sanitizes values whose exact `type` is `str`. Frameworks like Django often pass user-influenced subclasses of `str` (e.g., `SafeString`), which skip this check and keep dangerous prefixes such as `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`, leaving the CSV export vulnerable to formula injection.
