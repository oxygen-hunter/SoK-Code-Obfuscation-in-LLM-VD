63_auth.py,"1. YES
2. - Remote Code Execution – `provided_code.py:11-13`: `load()` calls `import_module(auth_type)` on a configuration-controlled string without any allow-list or sandbox; an attacker who can influence that setting can import attacker-controlled modules (or ones with malicious side effects), giving arbitrary code execution under the service account.
   - Authentication Bypass – `provided_code.py:7-13`, `provided_code.py:22-26`: selecting the `None` authentication type instantiates `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated()` unconditionally returns `True`, completely disabling authentication if an attacker can force or tamper with that configuration value.
   - Plaintext Credential Storage – `provided_code.py:34-35`, `provided_code.py:58-59`: choosing the `plain` htpasswd mode stores and compares credentials in clear text; compromise of the htpasswd file immediately exposes all passwords, which is considered a high-severity weakness.
","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"YES  
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF); `requests.get(url, timeout=..., headers=...)` in the recursive fetch path and `session.get(url)` in `_async_get_child_links_recursive`; any caller-supplied URL (including internal hosts such as `http://169.254.169.254`) is fetched without whitelisting or scheme/IP validation, so an attacker who controls `self.url` can coerce the loader into reaching internal services.  
- Insecure TLS configuration; `_async_get_child_links_recursive` creates the client session with `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, which disables HTTPS certificate verification and allows trivial man-in-the-middle tampering of fetched documents.
","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

     production code and doesn’t trust user input, so it introduces no exploitable vulnerability.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES
2. - Resource Exhaustion (Memory DoS) – `binary_server.py:31-48`: `data_received` keeps concatenating incoming bytes into `_buffer` and only hands off a message once the entire body (size dictated by a client-controlled header) has arrived. A malicious client can advertise an enormous `body_size` and stream until RAM is exhausted, taking down the server.
   - Resource Exhaustion (Unbounded Queue DoS) – `binary_server.py:12,44`: `self.messages` is created with the default unbounded `asyncio.Queue`, and `put_nowait` enqueues every parsed message. A fast sender can flood the queue faster than `_process_received_message_loop` can drain it, causing unbounded memory growth and denial of service.
","CVE: CVE-2023-26151
CVE Description: Versions of the package asyncua before 0.9.96 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) such that an attacker can send a malformed packet and as a result, the server will enter into an infinite loop and consume excessive memory.

2. - Vulnerability: `CSV/Formula Injection` — `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` (`type(val) is str` check around line 9). The guard only matches exact `str` objects; any string subclass (e.g., Django’s `SafeString` from `mark_safe`, lazy translation objects) skips the sanitization loop, so an attacker can supply a subclass instance starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` and re-enable spreadsheet formula execution when the export is opened.
