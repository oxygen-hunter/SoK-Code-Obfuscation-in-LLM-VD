2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Type: Arbitrary code execution (CWE-94) at `snippet.py:17`. The `load` function blindly passes the configuration-provided `auth_type` into `import_module(auth_type)`, so a malicious configuration can point to any module (including one they ship) and run attacker-controlled code during authentication setup.  
- Type: Authentication bypass (CWE-306) at `snippet.py:12-29`. Selecting the `""None""` auth type instantiates `NoneAuth`, whose `is_authenticated` method always returns `True`, so anyone can log in if they can influence the auth configuration.  
- Type: Plaintext password storage option (CWE-256) at `snippet.py:67-68`. When `htpasswd_encryption` is set to `""plain""`, the verifier compares raw strings, meaning the credential file must store cleartext passwords—compromise of that file exposes every password immediately.

","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"YES
- Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) — `recursive_url_loader.py:153` — The async loader creates `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`, globally disabling TLS certificate verification. Any HTTPS fetch done through this path will accept attacker-supplied certificates, enabling man-in-the-middle interception or content tampering.

  2. combo_L7/133_tests.py is a Django unit-test module that only mocks and exercises proxy/download protections; it never 
     ships as production logic or handles live user input, so it introduces no exploitable vulnerability.  
","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES  
2. - `Denial of Service` — `provided_code.py:62-65` — A partial TCP frame that doesn’t contain the full OPC UA header raises `NotEnoughData`; the handler immediately closes the transport instead of buffering and waiting for the rest of the header. Legitimate clients whose headers are split across packets will be dropped, and attackers can trivially keep the server busy by drip-feeding incomplete headers.  
   - `Denial of Service (memory exhaustion)` — `provided_code.py:22`, `provided_code.py:70-75` — Incoming messages are queued on an unbounded `asyncio.Queue` and `_buffer` accepts any `header.body_size` without validation. A client that sends well-formed messages faster than they are processed, or advertises/sends extremely large bodies, can force the server to retain arbitrarily large amounts of data in memory.
","CVE: CVE-2023-26151
CVE Description: Versions of the package asyncua before 0.9.96 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) such that an attacker can send a malformed packet and as a result, the server will enter into an infinite loop and consume excessive memory.

2. - Vulnerability Type: CSV / Formula Injection; Vulnerable Lines: `InvenTreeResource.export_resource` lines 10-46; Reason: attacker-controlled strings are only trimmed (`val = val.strip()`) and neither the `illegal_start_vals` list nor the attempted inline assembly actually remove leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, etc., so malicious formulas (e.g., `=HYPERLINK(...)`) are exported unchanged and will execute when the CSV is opened in spreadsheet software.
