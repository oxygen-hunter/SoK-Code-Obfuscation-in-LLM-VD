63_auth.py,"The code has a significant security vulnerability where it stores passwords in plain text when the encryption method is set to 'plain'. This allows unauthorized access to user credentials, leading to potential breaches.

1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Password Storage  
   - **Lines**: Lines 43-45 in the `_plain` method.  
   - **Reason**: When the encryption is set to 'plain', the code directly compares the stored hash with the plaintext password, storing credentials insecurely.

3. **Other Issues**:  
   - **Brute Force Delay**: The `time.sleep()` in `is_authenticated` might not effectively mitigate brute force attacks if the delay is predictable.  
   - **Dispatcher Logic**: The logic for setting `dispatcher` might allow loading unintended authentication classes if the configuration is tampered with, though this is more of a logic error than a direct vulnerability.

**Conclusion**: The primary and most critical issue is the insecure storage of passwords in plain text, which is a major security risk.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. **Vulnerable or Not**: YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Unrestricted URL Parsing**: The code uses `requests.get(url)` and `extract_sub_links` without proper validation, potentially allowing malicious URLs to be processed.  
   - **Session Handling**: The async method may leak resources if sessions aren't properly managed.  
3. **Reasoning**: The code could be vulnerable to URL injection or external link traversal if the `url` parameter isn't properly sanitized. Additionally, improper session handling in async operations might lead to resource leaks.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. **Vulnerable: YES**
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Denial of Service (DoS) and Resource Exhaustion
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: 
     - `OPCUAProtocol.data_received` (handling of incoming data without size checks)
     - `BinaryServer.start` (no rate limiting)
   - **Reason**: The code does not enforce message size limits or rate controls, allowing an attacker to send excessive data, causing the server to become unresponsive or consume excessive resources.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Task Leak
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `BinaryServer._close_task_loop` and `BinaryServer._close_tasks`
   - **Reason**: The task cleanup might not handle all tasks, potentially leaving some open and causing resource leaks.

3. **Vulnerability Type**: Insecure Data Handling
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `OPCUAProtocol.connection_lost` and `data_received`
   - **Reason**: Data might be processed after the connection is lost, leading to potential issues.

**Final Answer:**
The code is vulnerable. It has Denial of Service (DoS) and Resource Exhaustion vulnerabilities due to missing input validation and rate controls. Additionally, there's a potential task leak in the cleanup process, and insecure handling of data after connection loss.","CVE: CVE-2023-26151
