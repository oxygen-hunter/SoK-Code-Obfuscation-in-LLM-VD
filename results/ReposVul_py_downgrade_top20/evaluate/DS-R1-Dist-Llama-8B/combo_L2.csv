   - **Type of Vulnerability**: Arbitrary Code Execution, Insecure Hash Storage, Denial of Service (DoS), Insecure Module Imports, Insecure Crypt Function
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: 
     - Line 5: `class_ = import_module(auth_type).Auth` - Dynamically importing modules can lead to arbitrary code execution.
     - Lines 28-29: `time.sleep(1 + random.random())` - Potential DoS vulnerability.
     - Lines 34-35: Using `os.path.expanduser` without sanitization - Could lead to path traversal.
     - Lines 40-41: Insecure handling of `hash_value` in `_sha1` and `_ssha` methods - Missing salts.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. **Vulnerable or Not**: YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Improper Resource Leak in Async Method**  
     - **Lines**: `_async_get_child_links_recursive` method, lines where session isn't closed after exceptions.  
     - **Reason**: The code doesn't properly close the aiohttp session when exceptions occur, leading to potential resource leaks. This can cause issues like hanging connections or exhausted sockets, affecting the application's performance or causing errors when many requests are made.  

3. **Reason if Not Vulnerable**: The code doesn't exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF. It properly handles metadata extraction and link extraction with checks for external links. The main issue is resource management in the async method.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

133_tests.py,"1. **Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal in Proxy URL Handling**
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `test_proxy_url_forgery` method, specifically the URL construction using `urlsplit` and string concatenation.
   - **Reason**: The code constructs URLs with encoded characters like `@%23`, which can bypass proxy restrictions, potentially allowing path traversal or external redirect attacks.
   
2. **Vulnerability 2: Relative URL Handling**
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `test_relative_urls` method, where a relative URL is constructed and passed to the proxy.
   - **Reason**: The proxy might incorrectly resolve relative paths, leading to unintended access to external resources or internal files.

3. **Vulnerability 3: Missing Input Validation in OWS API**
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `test_ows_api` method, where the API endpoint is accessed without proper input validation.
   - **Reason**: The API might not validate incoming requests, allowing injection attacks or unauthorized access.

4. **Vulnerability 4: File Download Security**
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `test_download_url_with_not_existing_file` and `test_download_files` methods.
   - **Reason**: The download functionality might expose internal file structures or allow access to non-existent files, leading to potential security issues.

**Conclusion**: The code has multiple vulnerabilities related to URL handling and file downloads that could expose the application to security risks. These issues need to be addressed by implementing proper input validation and secure URL processing.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.
