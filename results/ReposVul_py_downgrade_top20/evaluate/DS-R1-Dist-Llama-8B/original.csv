   - **Lines**: The entire `Auth` class and related methods.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
   - **Type**: SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) and Resource Leak  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**:  
     - Lines where `requests.get()` is used in `_get_child_links_recursive` without an aiohttp session.  
     - Lines where `aiohttp.ClientSession` is not properly closed in `_async_get_child_links_recursive`.  
   - **Reason**: The code may allow untrusted URLs to be fetched, leading to potential SSRF attacks. Additionally, improper handling of aiohttp sessions can cause resource leaks, affecting performance and security.  

2. **Reason**: The code uses `requests.get()` in a synchronous context within an async framework, which can lead to issues. The async method doesn't properly close sessions, risking resource leaks. The `visited` set is shared across async tasks without proper synchronization, potentially causing concurrency issues.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

133_tests.py,"The code contains a security vulnerability related to URL handling in the `test_proxy_url_forgery` method. The test constructs a URL with a hostname and path that could potentially allow Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the proxy doesn't properly validate the URL.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
2. **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 123-133 in `ProxyTest` class, specifically the URL construction and the test case.
3. **Reason**: The code constructs a URL that includes a hostname and path which could allow an attacker to bypass the proxy's validation, leading to unauthorized access to internal resources.

The code is vulnerable because it does not properly validate the URL provided by the client, allowing potential SSRF attacks. The test expects a 403 status code, indicating the proxy should block such requests, but the implementation might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to a security risk.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable**: YES
2. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Lines 123-133 in `ProxyTest` class.
     - **Reason**: The code constructs a URL that could allow an attacker to bypass the proxy's validation, leading to unauthorized access.
3. **Reason**: The test case attempts to exploit a potential SSRF vulnerability by constructing a URL with a hostname and path that might not be properly validated by the proxy, posing a security risk.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.
