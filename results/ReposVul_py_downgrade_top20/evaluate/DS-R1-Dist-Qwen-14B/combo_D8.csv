132_recursive_url_loader.py,"The provided code contains several security vulnerabilities. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Blocking Async IO with Synchronous Calls**:
   - **Vulnerable Line**: `response = requests.get(url, timeout=self.timeout, headers=self.headers)`
   - **Reason**: Using `requests.get` in an async context blocks the event loop, causing performance issues and potential deadlocks.

2. **Insecure SSL Handling**:
   - **Vulnerable Line**: `aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)`
   - **Reason**: Disabling SSL in `aiohttp` allows man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.

3. **Lack of Redirect Handling**:
   - **Vulnerable Line**: The code doesn't handle redirects after `response.status_code` checks.
   - **Reason**: Without following redirects, the crawler might miss content or process incorrect URLs, leading to incomplete data retrieval.

4. **Potential Resource Leaks**:
   - **Vulnerable Line**: Session management in `_async_get_child_links_recursive`.
   - **Reason**: Improper session closure could lead to resource leaks","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"The provided code has several potential security vulnerabilities and resource management issues. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Resource Leaks and Infinite Loops**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The `OPCUAProtocol` class has an infinite loop in `_process_received_message_loop` that may not exit properly if the `processor.process` method fails or raises exceptions. Similarly, `BinaryServer` has an infinite loop in `_close_task_loop` that could run indefinitely without proper termination.
   - **Reason**: These loops lack proper exit conditions beyond receiving `None` values, which might not always be triggered, leading to resource exhaustion or indefinite processing.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: In `data_received` and `_process_one_msg`, exceptions are caught but not fully handled, potentially allowing exceptions to go","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - **Type**: CSV Injection (Formula Injection).
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 15-22 in the `export_resource` method.
   - **Reason**: The code only strips illegal leading characters, leaving potential vulnerabilities where malicious content can be injected elsewhere in the string or in non-string data types.

3. The code is vulnerable because it doesn't comprehensively sanitize all potentially dangerous characters throughout the entire string, allowing for other injection points beyond the leading characters.

4. The code's approach is insufficient as it only addresses the start of strings, missing other possible attack vectors.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
