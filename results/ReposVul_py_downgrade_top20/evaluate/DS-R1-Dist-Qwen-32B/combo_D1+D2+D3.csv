2. **Vulnerabilities Identified**:

   - **Insecure Authentication in NoneAuth**:
     - **Lines**: `class NoneAuth(BaseAuth):` and `return (1 == 2) or (not False or True or 1 == 1)`
     - **Reason**: The `is_authenticated` method always returns True, effectively disabling authentication, which is a major security risk.

   - **Dynamic Module Import**:
     - **Lines**: `class_ = import_module(auth_type).Auth`
     - **Reason**: Allowing arbitrary module imports based on configuration can lead to code injection if the `auth_type` is not properly validated.

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**

   - **Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration (Vulnerable Line: 125)**
     - **Reason:** The async method creates an aiohttp session with `ssl=False`, disabling SSL certificate verification. This exposes the application to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing potential eavesdropping or tampering of data in transit.

   - **Improper HTTP Response Handling (Vulnerable Line: 83 and 137)**
     - **Reason:** The `check_response_status` parameter is set to False by default, causing the loader to process HTTP responses with non-success status codes (e.g., 404","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

133_tests.py,"The provided code is a series of test cases for a Django application, focusing on proxy functionality and download features. Upon analysis, no direct security vulnerabilities are present within the test code itself. The tests are structured to check various scenarios, including URL handling, header preservation, and file downloads, using appropriate mocking and assertions. While some practices like hardcoded passwords are noted, they are typical in test environments. The tests do not expose vulnerabilities but rather simulate potential attack vectors to ensure the application handles them correctly. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable?** NO  
2. **Reason:** The code consists of test cases that do not introduce vulnerabilities. They properly use mocks and test edge cases without exposing security flaws.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

165_admin.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES

2. **Vulnerabilities Identified:**
   - **Type:** CSV Injection (OWASP A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration)
   - **Vulnerable Lines:** Lines within the `export_resource` method, specifically the while loop condition and slicing logic.
   - **Reason:** The code attempts to prevent CSV injection by stripping illegal starting characters but fails due to incorrect indexing and incomplete removal of all illegal prefixes. The while loop checks the second character instead of the first, and the slicing logic doesn't ensure all illegal starting characters are removed, leaving potential vectors for formula injection.

3. **Recommendation:**
   - Correct the indexing to check and remove the first character if it's illegal.
   - Implement a loop that continues to strip the first character until it's safe.
   - Use a set for illegal_start_vals to avoid redundancy and improve efficiency.
   - Handle cases where stripping results in an empty string appropriately.

**Corrected Code Example:**

```python
def export_resource(self, obj):
    """"""Custom function to override default row export behaviour.

    Specifically, strip illegal leading characters to prevent formula injection
    """"""
    row = super().export_resource(obj)

    illegal_start_vals = {'@', '=', '+', '-', '\t', '\r', '\n'}

    for idx, val in enumerate(row):
