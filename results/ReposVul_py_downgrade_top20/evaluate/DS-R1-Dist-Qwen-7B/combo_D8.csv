63_auth.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.

2. The vulnerabilities identified are:
   - **Weak hashing methods**: The code uses MD5 (via `apr_md5_crypt`), which is insecure and easily crackable. This is a major security risk as it allows attackers to brute-force passwords more effectively.
   - **Timing attack risk**: The `is_authenticated` method includes a loop with a random sleep, which could potentially leak timing information, allowing attackers to guess passwords faster.
   - **Plaintext password storage**: The password is stored as plaintext in the hash file, meaning it can be easily retrieved if the file is compromised.

3. The code does not use bcrypt by default, which is a more secure hashing algorithm. Using MD5 could be a critical security flaw depending on the context of use.

**Recommendation**: The code should be updated to use bcrypt for password hashing by default and ensure that all password-related operations are performed securely, including proper encryption and storage practices.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Insufficient Authorization:** The code uses `requests` without proper authentication headers, making the requests vulnerable to interception or spoofing.
   - **No CSRF Protection:** The application lacks CSRF tokens, increasing the risk of CSRF attacks.
   - **Insecure `requests` Usage:** The use of `requests` without secure practices and potential vulnerabilities in `extract_sub_links` function.
   - **Resource Leaks:** Improper handling of async sessions and closures could lead to resource leaks.
3. **Reason:** The code has multiple security issues including lack of authentication, CSRF protection, and improper handling of async resources, making it vulnerable to various security threats.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

   - **Type:** Potential NoneType Errors and Indefinite Loops
   - **Vulnerable Lines:**
     - Lines where `getValueNone()` is used (e.g., `self.iserver: InternalServer = getValueNone()`, `self._server: Optional[asyncio.AbstractServer] = getValueNone()`, etc.).
     - Indefinite loops in `OPCUAProtocol._process_received_message_loop` and `BinaryServer._close_task_loop`.
   - **Reason:** Using `getValueNone()` can lead to `None` being assigned to critical variables like `iserver`, `_server`, etc., causing runtime errors. The loops may run indefinitely without proper exit conditions","CVE: CVE-2023-26151

165_admin.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - The `get_illegal_start_vals()` function includes the character '@' twice, which is redundant and could cause unexpected behavior.  
   - The `clean_value` function only removes the first occurrence of each illegal character, not all of them, potentially leaving some vulnerabilities.  
   - The code does not handle Unicode whitespace, which could be a problem in some environments.  
   - The `clean_value` function is redefined inside the loop, which is inefficient but not a security issue.  

The vulnerabilities exist because the sanitization process is incomplete and includes redundant characters, which could allow for formula injection or other malicious activities.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
