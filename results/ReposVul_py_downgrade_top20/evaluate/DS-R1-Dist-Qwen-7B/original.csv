63_auth.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Insecure Encryption Methods:** The code supports plain, SHA1, and CRYPT encryption, which are insecure according to the documentation. These methods are vulnerable to brute force attacks.
   - **No File Existence Check:** The code does not verify if the htpasswd file exists or is readable, which can lead to crashes or incorrect authentication results if the file is missing or corrupted.
   - **No Proper Handling of User Existence:** The code does not check if the user exists in the system before attempting to authenticate, which can lead to false positives.
   - **Insufficient Timing Protection:** The random delay added after exhausting the htpasswd file might not be sufficient against active brute force attacks.
   - **Incorrect Imports:** The code uses `importlib.import_module` without checking if the module exists, which can cause runtime errors if certain modules (like passlib) are not available.
3. **Reason:** The code uses insecure encryption methods and does not adequately handle potential issues like missing files, corrupted files, or active brute force attacks. Additionally, it does not properly check if the user exists locally before attempting to match their login and password from htpasswd.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342
CVE Description: Radicale before 1.1.2 and 2.x before 2.0.0rc2 is prone to timing oracles and simple brute-force attacks when using the htpasswd authentication method.

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The code uses `requests.get` and `aiohttp.ClientSession` without CSRF tokens, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
   - **Improper SSL Handling:** Using `ssl=False` in async mode allows execution of arbitrary code on servers with disabled SSL, posing a security risk.
   - **Potential Infinite Recursion:** The `_get_child_links_recursive` method doesn't check if a URL has been visited, risking infinite loops.
3. **Reason:** The code lacks essential security measures like CSRF protection and proper SSL handling, making it vulnerable to various attacks and potential infinite loops.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

133_tests.py,"1. **NO**  
   The provided code is a test suite and does not include the actual application logic that could introduce vulnerabilities. It focuses on testing proxy settings, resource downloads, and OWS API interactions through various test cases.

2. **NO**  
   The test cases provided do not reveal any specific vulnerabilities. They verify the correct behavior of the proxy under different conditions (e.g., allowed/disallowed hosts, file downloads, OWS API interactions) but do not expose any actual security flaws in the application logic.

3. **NO**  
   Since the code provided is test cases and not the actual application code, there are no specific vulnerabilities to report. The tests are designed to ensure the application behaves correctly under various scenarios but do not actively check for security issues.

4. **NO**  
   The provided code is a test suite and does not include the actual application code that could introduce vulnerabilities. The tests focus on verifying the correct behavior of the proxy and resource download features but do not expose any actual security flaws in the application logic.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:** The code lacks proper input validation and sanitization, which could allow malicious data to cause code injection or unexpected behavior.
   - **Inadequate Exception Handling:** The code catches exceptions but doesn't prevent potential security exploits, such as allowing attackers to exploit system vulnerabilities.
   - **No Secure Communication:** The server uses default socket communication without encryption, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Lack of Authentication and Authorization:** The server doesn't implement authentication or authorization, allowing untrusted clients to connect and send data.
3. **Reason:** The code doesn't sanitize input, handle exceptions securely, use secure communication methods, or implement authentication, making it vulnerable to various attacks.","CVE: CVE-2023-26151
