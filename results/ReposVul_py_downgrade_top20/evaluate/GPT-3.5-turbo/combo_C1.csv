2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Opaque predicate: The code contains two instances of opaque predicates, which are conditions that are always true or false, making the code difficult to analyze and potentially hiding malicious behavior. 
     - Lines: 
       - Line 23: `if random.choice([True, False]):`
       - Line 77: `if 1 == 1:`
     - Reason: Opaque predicates can be used to obfuscate malicious behavior or make the code harder to analyze for security vulnerabilities.

3. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to the presence of opaque predicates, which can make it difficult to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities.

4. Note: The code may have additional vulnerabilities that are not detected by the current analysis.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

   - Reason: The code uses string formatting to construct URLs without proper validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the URL input to execute arbitrary code or perform malicious actions.

2. YES
   - Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   - Vulnerable Lines: 221
   - Reason: The code reveals sensitive information such as the hostname of the site in the URL construction, which can be exploited by an attacker to gather information for further attacks.

3. YES
   - Vulnerability Type: Zip Slip
   - Vulnerable Lines: 235
   - Reason: The code does not properly sanitize the input for zip file extraction, which can lead to a Zip Slip vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious zip file to overwrite sensitive files on the system.

4. YES
   - Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
   - Vulnerable Lines: 269
   - Reason: The code exposes sensitive information such as the server headers in the response, which can be used by an attacker to gather information about the server configuration and potentially exploit known vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - CSV Injection: The code is vulnerable to CSV Injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of exported data. The vulnerable lines are:
     - Line 18: The `export_resource` method does not properly sanitize the exported data to prevent malicious formula injection.
     - Line 23: The `illegal_start_vals` list contains characters that can be used in CSV injection attacks.
     - Line 29: The `val` variable is not properly sanitized to prevent CSV injection.
     - Line 33: The condition `if irrelevant_value == 42` does not serve any security purpose and is irrelevant.

3. Reason: The code lacks proper sanitization of exported data, making it vulnerable to CSV Injection attacks.

4. Recommendation: Sanitize the exported data properly to prevent CSV Injection attacks. Consider using a library or built-in functions to handle CSV data securely.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
