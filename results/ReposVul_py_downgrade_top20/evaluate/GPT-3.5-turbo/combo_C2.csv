2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Password Hashing):
     - Vulnerable lines: 77-79, 83-85, 89-91, 95-97, 101-103, 107-109
     - Reason: The code uses weak or outdated cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA1, MD5, and crypt for password hashing, which are not considered secure for storing passwords. These algorithms are vulnerable to various attacks like brute force, rainbow table attacks, and more. It is recommended to use stronger and more secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.

3. Recommendation:
   - Upgrade the password hashing mechanism to use a more secure algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to protect user passwords effectively.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 173-196
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, which can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities.
   - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `test_validate_remote_services_hosts` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 77-94
     - Reason: The code makes requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user, which can be exploited for SSRF attacks.

3. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent IDOR and SSRF vulnerabilities.

4. Note: The other methods in the code seem to be secure based on the provided context.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerability Type: CSV Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 20-39
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to CSV Injection as it does not properly sanitize the exported data. The code attempts to strip illegal leading characters to prevent formula injection, but this approach is not comprehensive and may still leave room for exploitation.
