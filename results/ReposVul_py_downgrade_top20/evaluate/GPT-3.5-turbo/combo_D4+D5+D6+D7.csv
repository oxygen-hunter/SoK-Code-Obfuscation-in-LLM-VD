63_auth.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Line 77): The code uses weak cryptographic methods like MD5, SHA1, and crypt for password hashing, which are considered insecure and can be easily cracked. These methods are not recommended for storing passwords securely.
   - Lack of Input Validation (Line 77): The code does not validate the input data before processing it, which can lead to various security issues such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
   - Timing Attack Vulnerability (Line 106): The code uses time.sleep() with a random delay, which can potentially leak information through timing attacks, especially during the authentication process.

3. Reason for vulnerability:
   - The code uses weak cryptographic methods like MD5, SHA1, and crypt for password hashing, which are known to be insecure and can be easily cracked by attackers.
   - Lack of input validation can lead to security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
   - Timing attacks can exploit the random delay introduced by time.sleep() to leak information about the authentication process.

4. Recommendation:
   - Use stronger cryptographic methods like bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing to improve security.
   - Implement input validation to sanitize and validate user inputs before processing them to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - Avoid using time delays in authentication processes to mitigate timing attack vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `ProxyTest.test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 173-186
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, which can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the URL to access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions.
   - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `ProxyTest.test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 173-186
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input and does not properly validate the input. This can allow an attacker to make the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.
   - Lack of input validation in `ProxyTest.test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 173-186
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input URL properly, allowing for various forms of attacks including SSRF and IDOR.

3. The code is vulnerable to IDOR, SSRF, and lack of input validation due to insecure URL construction and lack of input validation in the `ProxyTest.test_proxy_url_forgery` method.

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerability Type: CSV Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 20-38
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to CSV Injection as it does not properly sanitize the exported data. The code attempts to strip illegal leading characters to prevent formula injection, but it is not a reliable method to prevent CSV Injection. An attacker could still craft a malicious payload that could lead to formula injection when the exported data is opened in a spreadsheet application.

3. Recommendation: Instead of manually stripping characters, it is recommended to use a proper CSV library that handles escaping and sanitization of data to prevent CSV Injection vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
