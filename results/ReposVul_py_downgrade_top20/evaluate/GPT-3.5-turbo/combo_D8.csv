2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 134-153:
     - Vulnerable lines: 134-153
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, which can lead to URL manipulation attacks.
   - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 134-153:
     - Vulnerable lines: 134-153
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input and makes requests to potentially malicious URLs, which can lead to SSRF attacks.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, which can lead to URL manipulation and SSRF attacks.

4. Note: The code should validate and sanitize user input when constructing URLs to prevent IDOR and SSRF vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.
