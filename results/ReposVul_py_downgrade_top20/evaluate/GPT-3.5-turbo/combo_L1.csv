2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the `OX6B9E8D2A` method of the `OX7A2E0B9D` class at line 123.
     Reason: The `OX6B9E8D2A` method reads a file specified by the user input `OX7A3C2D1F` without proper validation, which can lead to an IDOR vulnerability.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and access control mechanisms to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities. Ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated before accessing files.

   - The code may have other vulnerabilities that were not detected in this analysis.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Importing modules using wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and make it difficult to track the origin of functions and classes. It is recommended to import specific functions or classes instead of using wildcard imports.
     - Vulnerable lines: All import statements using wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`)
     - Reason: Wildcard imports can make the code less maintainable and increase the risk of naming conflicts.

3. The code is vulnerable due to the use of wildcard imports.

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.
