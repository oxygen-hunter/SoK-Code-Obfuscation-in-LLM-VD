   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Password Hashing):
     - Vulnerable lines: 47-49, 51-53, 55-57, 59-61, 63-65, 67-69, 71-73
     - Reason: The code implements various password hashing algorithms like SHA1, SSHA, MD5, Bcrypt, and Crypt for storing passwords. However, the implementation of these algorithms may have vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. It is recommended to use more secure and up-to-date hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt for password hashing.

3. Recommendation: Update the password hashing mechanisms to use more secure algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt to mitigate the risk of password hash vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 134-153:
     - Vulnerable lines: 134-153
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, which can lead to URL manipulation and potential security risks.
   - Lack of input validation in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 134-153:
     - Vulnerable lines: 134-153
     - Reason: The code does not properly validate the input URLs, allowing for potential injection attacks.
   - Lack of proper header validation in `test_proxy_preserve_headers` method at lines 68-89:
     - Vulnerable lines: 68-89
     - Reason: The code does not validate all response headers properly, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - Lack of proper URL validation in `test_relative_urls` method at lines 45-56:
     - Vulnerable lines: 45-56
     - Reason: The code does not validate the input URL properly, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization for user-controlled URLs.
   - Validate and sanitize all headers in the response to prevent header manipulation attacks.
   - Ensure that URLs are properly validated to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

4. Note:
   - Further analysis may be required to identify additional vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

   - Insecure data handling
   - The vulnerable line is: 
     ```python

     ```
   - Reason: The code is using the `is` operator to compare types, which can lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to use the `isinstance()` function for type checking in Python.

3. Recommendation: Replace `if type(val) is str:` with `if isinstance(val, str):` to improve the code's security and reliability.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
