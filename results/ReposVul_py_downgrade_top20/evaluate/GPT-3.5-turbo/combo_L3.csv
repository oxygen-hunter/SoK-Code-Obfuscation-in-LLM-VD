132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Import Injection: The code imports modules dynamically based on conditions, which can lead to import injection vulnerabilities. (Line 3)
   - Code Injection: The code uses BeautifulSoup without proper input validation, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. (Line 17)
   - Command Injection: The code uses requests.get without validating the input URL, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. (Line 41)
   - Missing Input Validation: The code does not validate the input URL before making requests, which can lead to various security vulnerabilities. (Line 41)
   - Insecure Dependency: The code uses aiohttp without proper error handling, which can lead to insecure dependency vulnerabilities. (Line 63)
   - Information Disclosure: The code logs potentially sensitive information like errors and URLs, which can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities. (Lines 17, 45, 67)
   - Lack of CSRF Protection: The code does not implement CSRF protection for requests, which can lead to CSRF vulnerabilities. (No specific line)
3. Reason: The code contains multiple security vulnerabilities as listed above.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 123-134
     - Reason: The code allows an attacker to manipulate the URL and access unauthorized resources by bypassing the intended restrictions. The code does not properly validate and sanitize the input URL, leading to potential IDOR vulnerabilities.
   - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method:
     - Vulnerable lines: 123-134
     - Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, allowing an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal or external servers, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code does not properly validate and sanitize user input when constructing URLs, leading to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.

4. Note: The code may also have other security vulnerabilities that need further review and testing.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerability Type: CSV Injection
   Vulnerable Lines: 6, 10-15
   Reason: The code is vulnerable to CSV Injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of exported data. The custom export_resource function does not properly escape or sanitize the data before exporting, which can lead to malicious formula injection when the exported data is opened in a spreadsheet application.
