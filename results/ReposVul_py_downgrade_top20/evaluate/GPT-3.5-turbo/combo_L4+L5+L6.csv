2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Password Hashing):
     - Vulnerable lines: 33-77
     - Reason: The code implements various password hashing methods like SHA1, SSHA, MD5, Bcrypt, and Crypt. However, the implementation of these methods is not secure. For example, the MD5 hashing method is known to be weak and vulnerable to attacks. Similarly, the SHA1 hashing method is also considered weak. Storing passwords using these methods can lead to security vulnerabilities as attackers can easily crack the hashed passwords.

3. Recommendation:
   - Use stronger and more secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.
   - Avoid using weak hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA1.
   - Implement proper salting and iteration count for password hashing to increase the security of stored passwords.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - CSV Injection Vulnerability
     - Vulnerable lines: 20, 26
     - Reason: The code does not properly sanitize the exported data to prevent CSV injection attacks. The `sanitize_value` function only removes illegal leading characters, but it does not handle other potential CSV injection vectors such as injecting formulas or special characters.

3. Recommendations:
   - Implement a more comprehensive sanitization mechanism to prevent CSV injection attacks. This can include encoding special characters, escaping formulas, and validating the data format before exporting.

4. Additional Notes:
   - It's important to thoroughly review and test the data export functionality to ensure that all potential security risks are mitigated.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
