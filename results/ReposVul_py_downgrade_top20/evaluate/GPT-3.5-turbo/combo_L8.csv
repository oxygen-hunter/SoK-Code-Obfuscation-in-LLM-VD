2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Cryptographic Storage (Password Hashing):
     - Vulnerable lines: 47-49, 51-53, 55-57, 59-61, 63-65, 67-69, 71-73
     - Reason: The code uses various encryption methods for password hashing like plain, crypt, sha1, ssha, bcrypt, and md5. Some of these methods are weak and can be easily cracked. For example, using plain text for password storage (line 47-49) is highly insecure. Similarly, using outdated or weak hashing algorithms like md5 (line 63-65) and sha1 (line 51-53) can lead to vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use stronger and more secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt for password hashing.

3. Recommendation: 
   - Use a secure and modern hashing algorithm like bcrypt for password hashing to ensure better security.
   - Avoid using weak or outdated hashing algorithms like md5 and sha1.
   - Implement proper password storage mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to user passwords.","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

132_recursive_url_loader.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in the `_get_child_links_recursive` method at line 77:
     The method `requests.get(url, timeout=self.timeout, headers=self.headers)` directly fetches the content from the provided URL without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the URL to access unauthorized resources or sensitive information.

   - Command Injection in the `call_c_function` function at line 123:
     The function constructs the library name using user-controlled input without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the `libname` variable to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities such as IDOR and Command Injection.

4. Recommendation:
   - For IDOR vulnerability, ensure that the URLs are properly validated and authorized before making requests.
   - For Command Injection vulnerability, sanitize and validate user inputs before constructing file paths or executing external commands.","CVE: CVE-2023-46229

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `test_proxy_url_forgery` method at lines 148-166:
     The code allows non-legit requests attempting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by constructing URLs with arbitrary hosts. This can lead to security risks such as accessing internal resources or performing unauthorized actions.
     Vulnerable lines: 156, 162
     Reason: The code constructs URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, allowing attackers to manipulate the URL and potentially access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.

3. Reason for vulnerability: The code does not properly validate user-controlled input when constructing URLs, which can lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.

4. Note: The codebase seems to have good practices in terms of handling headers, testing download functionalities, and API endpoints.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary Code Execution
   Vulnerable Lines: 20, 22
   Reason: The code dynamically generates and compiles a C code snippet at runtime, writes it to a file, and then loads and executes the compiled shared object file. This approach allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the system, leading to potential code execution vulnerabilities.

3. The code is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to the dynamic generation and execution of C code at runtime.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
