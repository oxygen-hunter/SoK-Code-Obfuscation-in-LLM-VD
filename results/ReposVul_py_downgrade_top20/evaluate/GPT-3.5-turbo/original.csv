2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Password Encryption: The code uses various insecure password encryption methods such as plain-text, CRYPT, and SHA1. These encryption methods are considered insecure and can lead to password compromise.
     - Vulnerable lines: 53-55, 59-61
     - Reason: Storing passwords using insecure encryption methods can expose user credentials to attackers.

3. The code also lacks proper input validation and error handling, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in `ProxyTest.test_proxy_url_forgery`:
     - Vulnerable lines: 174-186
     - Reason: The code allows non-legitimate requests attempting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by accepting URLs with special characters that can manipulate the request to access unauthorized resources. This can lead to security risks such as information disclosure or unauthorized access.
   
3. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent SSRF attacks. Ensure that the proxy only allows requests to legitimate and safe URLs.

4. Note: The codebase seems to have good test coverage and security measures in place, but the vulnerability mentioned above should be addressed to enhance the overall security posture.","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - CSV Injection
   - Vulnerable lines: 20, 26
   - Reason: The code does not properly sanitize the exported data to prevent CSV Injection attacks. The `export_resource` function does not escape or sanitize the data before exporting, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious formulas into the exported CSV file. The code attempts to strip illegal leading characters, but this approach is not sufficient to prevent CSV Injection vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent CSV Injection attacks. Consider using a library or built-in functions to properly escape the data before exporting it.","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
