2. - Arbitrary code execution via unsafe dynamic import: line 17 (c = import_module(t).Auth). If cfg[""auth""][""type""] is attacker-controlled, arbitrary modules can be imported and executed.
   - Authentication bypass (insecure “None” mode): lines 12–14 and 28–30 (NoneAuth returns True). Selecting type ""None"" disables authentication entirely.
   - Weak/insecure password storage/verification:
     - Plaintext: lines 42–43 and 66–67 (hv == pw). Stores/verifies passwords in clear; trivially compromised.
     - SHA-1: lines 40–41 and 72–77. SHA-1 is cryptographically broken and very fast to brute-force.
     - SSHA (salted SHA-1): lines 38–39 and 79–87. Still based on SHA-1; fast and weak against modern cracking.
     - apr1 MD5: lines 44–49 and 92–93. MD5-based scheme is outdated and fast to brute-force compared to modern KDFs.
     - crypt(): lines 57–62 and 69–70. System crypt may default to weak/low-cost schemes; strength not enforced.
   - Timing side-channel on authentication outcome: lines 101–103. Success returns immediately while failure sleeps 1–2s, enabling attackers to detect valid credential pairs by response time.
   - Non-constant-time hash comparisons: lines 66–67, 69–70, 77, 87. Using == can leak slight timing differences; use hmac.compare_digest to mitigate.
   - Information leakage in error messages: lines 48, 54, 61, 64. Detailed RuntimeError messages expose configuration/back-end details that may aid attackers.

1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: NO

3. Reason:
- This is a Django test module exercising application endpoints with controlled inputs. It uses the Django test client, RequestFactory, and mocks (patch/MagicMock) to avoid real external I/O.
- No unsafe operations (e.g., command execution, unsafe deserialization, direct filesystem writes to sensitive paths) are present. File access is mocked (storage_manager.open/exists), and HTTP fetching is mocked where used.
- Any real security concerns (SSRF, path traversal, header handling, zip creation) would be in the production code under test (geonode.proxy.views, download views, helpers), which is not part of this snippet.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. - CSV/Spreadsheet Formula Injection (improper neutralization) — vulnerable at the line ""if type(v) is str:"" inside export_resource: only exact built-in str values are sanitized; str subclasses (e.g., Django’s SafeString) and non-str objects with attacker-controlled __str__() bypass the check and can start with =, +, -, or @, executing as formulas in spreadsheet apps.
   - Inadequate mitigation strategy (destructive stripping instead of safe prefixing) — vulnerable in the while loop that removes leading special characters: stripping characters alters data and is not a robust neutralization; best practice is to consistently prefix risky values (e.g., with a single quote) after coercing all values to str, ensuring no formula is executed.
