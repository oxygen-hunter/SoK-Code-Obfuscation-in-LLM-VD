2. Vulnerabilities:
- Insecure dynamic import/code execution: line 17; Reason: imports a module name from configuration without allowlisting, enabling arbitrary code execution if config or import path is attacker-controlled.
- Authentication bypass (“None” auth): lines 12–13 and 31–33; Reason: NoneAuth always returns True, disabling authentication if misconfigured or abused.
- Plaintext password storage/verification: lines 46–47 and 78–79; Reason: compares stored value to password directly, exposing credentials if file is read and enabling offline compromise.
- Unsalted SHA-1 password verification: lines 44–45 and 84–89; Reason: SHA-1 without salt is cryptographically weak and vulnerable to fast offline attacks.
- Broken SSHA verification and weak hash: lines 42–43 and 91–100 (especially 95–96); Reason: salt extraction is wrong (salt_value becomes empty), effectively reducing SSHA to unsalted SHA-1; SHA-1 itself is weak.
- MD5-based password hashing: lines 48–55 and 105–106; Reason: apr_md5_crypt/MD5 are outdated and susceptible to brute-force.
- Potentially weak system crypt(): lines 65–72 and 81–82; Reason: accepts whatever scheme crypt() indicates (e.g., DES/MD5), which may be weak; no enforcement of strong variants.
- Non-constant-time comparisons enabling timing attacks: lines 79, 89, 100; Reason: byte-wise ‘==’ leaks comparison timing; use hmac.compare_digest or KDF verifier primitives instead.
- DoS via unvalidated encoding selection: lines 86 and 94; Reason: attacker-controlled encoding value (if config is untrusted) can cause exceptions or mis-decoding, leading to auth failures/DoS.

3. Reason: The file is a Django test suite using controlled inputs and mocks. Hardcoded test credentials and sample URLs are confined to the test context. No paths to production exploits: no user-supplied data reaches dangerous sinks (OS commands, eval, deserialization, file system writes outside mocks, or network without host restrictions). Assertions exercise SSRF and header handling logic rather than weaken it.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40017
CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Denial of Service (memory exhaustion)
     - Vulnerable lines: OPCUAProtocol.__init__: messages = asyncio.Queue(); OPCUAProtocol.data_received: self._buffer += data; if len(buf) < header.body_size: return; self.messages.put_nowait((header, buf))
     - Reason: No maximum frame/body size, unbounded connection buffer, and unbounded queue let an attacker advertise huge body_size or flood valid frames to grow memory arbitrarily.
   - Cleartext transport (lack of TLS/SSL)
     - Vulnerable lines: BinaryServer.start: create_server(self._make_protocol, self.hostname, self.port) (no ssl/SSLContext provided)
     - Reason: Connections are unencrypted and unauthenticated at the transport layer, enabling MITM/sniffing unless OPC UA security is strictly enforced at a higher layer; supply an SSLContext to encrypt on the wire if required.
   - Log injection / log flooding
     - Vulnerable lines: data_received: logger.error(f'Got malformed header {header}'); multiple logger.exception(...) with potentially attacker-controlled content
     - Reason: Untrusted values (e.g., header.__str__ or large buffers) are logged without size limits or sanitization, allowing CRLF log forging and excessive log growth.

2. Vulnerabilities: (a) Spreadsheet/CSV formula injection bypass via Unicode prefix characters (e.g., U+200B zero-width space, U+FEFF BOM) not removed or normalized, so a value like “\u200B=cmd” passes checks and may still be interpreted as a formula by spreadsheet apps (lines 5, 8-10); (b) Sanitization skipped for string subclasses (e.g., Django SafeString) because of exact type check, allowing bypass of all stripping (line 7: use isinstance instead of type(...) is str); (c) Destructive sanitization/data integrity risk by stripping legitimate leading characters and whitespace, potentially corrupting exported data and enabling logic confusion (lines 8-10).
