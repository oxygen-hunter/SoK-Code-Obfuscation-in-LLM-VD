2. Vulnerabilities found:

 • Insecure password verification methods  
  – Vulnerable lines: the switch in methods used in Auth.__init__ (approximately lines 44–72) and their implementations (e.g. _plain, _sha1, _crypt)  
  – Reason: The code supports several weak and outright insecure methods (plain-text, CRYPT, SHA1) for password verification. Although this is documented in comments and is controlled by configuration, if a deployment uses one of these methods the authentication relies on algorithms that are considered","CVE: CVE-2017-8342

CVE Description: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. In versions 3.2.0 through 4.1.2, the endpoint `/proxy/?url=` does not properly protect against server-side request forgery. This allows an attacker to port scan internal hosts and request information from internal hosts. A patch is available at commit a9eebae80cb362009660a1fd49e105e7cdb499b9.

143_binary_server_asyncio.py,"1. YES

2. The code is vulnerable. Here are the identified vulnerabilities:

 a. Unbounded Message Queue (Denial‐of‐Service)  
  • Vulnerable “lines”: In the OPCUAProtocol.__init__ method where ""self.messages = asyncio.Queue()"" is created and later used in _process_received_message_loop (lines inside the OPCUAProtocol class, approximately lines 22–30 and 86–90).  
  • Reason: The asyncio.Queue is instantiated without a maximum size. A malicious client (or a flood of connections) could enqueue an excessive number of messages, eventually consuming too much memory and leading to a denial‐of‐service condition.

 b. Unrestricted Message Size Handling (Resource Exhaustion)  
  • Vulnerable “lines”: In OPCUAProtocol.data_received (roughly lines 38–60) the code parses incoming data without validating a maximum allowed message (or body) size.  
  • Reason: The header’s body_size is taken from the client’s input and is only conditionally checked (e.g. via “if header.header_size + header.body_size <= header.header_size:”). There is no upper bound or sanity check on header.body_size. Thus, an attacker might send a header with an extremely large declared body size to force the protocol into waiting for a huge amount of data (or to keep the incomplete data in the buffer), potentially exhausting memory or keeping connections open indefinitely.

 c. Lack of Authentication and Encryption  
  • Vulnerable “lines”: Throughout the connection_made, data_received, and overall server start/stop logic (the security model is absent in BinaryServer.start and OPCUAProtocol.connection_made).  
  • Reason: The code does not perform any authentication or integrity checks on incoming connections. In scenarios where this server is exposed outside a controlled network, an attacker might impersonate legitimate clients or eavesdrop on unencrypted traffic.

3. These vulnerabilities are significant because they allow a remote actor to misuse the service through resource exhaustion (DoS) or to potentially intercept/manipulate communications. In production deployments, adding limits (maximum message sizes and queue lengths), proper input validation, and implementing authentication/encryption mechanisms is crucial.

2. Explanation:  
   • The code is designed to defend against CSV injection by stripping any leading characters (such as “@”, “=”, “+”, “-”, tabs, and newline characters) that could trigger unwanted behavior in spreadsheet software.  
   • This sanitization occurs for every string field during the export process, thereby mitigating the risk of formula injection.  
   • There are no other security concerns evident in this snippet.  
   • (Note: The duplicate entry for '@' in the list “illegal_start_vals” is likely an oversight, but it does not introduce a security vulnerability.)","CVE: CVE-2022-2112
