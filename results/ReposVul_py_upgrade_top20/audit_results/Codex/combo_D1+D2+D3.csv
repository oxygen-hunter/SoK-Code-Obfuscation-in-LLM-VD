2. - Cryptographic implementation flaw – `snippet.py:20-31`: the generator validation is effectively disabled because every attempt to clear `safe` uses the C-style operators `||`/`&&`, which are never evaluated in Python. As a result the loop breaks on the first random `g`, so values such as `g = 1` are accepted. With `g = 1` the ciphertext becomes `(a=1, b=M)`, fully exposing the plaintext and enabling trivial small-subgroup attacks on the private key.
   - Denial of service – `snippet.py:63`: `_verify()` references `p` instead of `self.p`. Any call that reaches this branch raises a `NameError`, letting an attacker crash the verifier (or any service that depends on it) with a crafted signature query.

2. - Path traversal / arbitrary file read (`static_view.get_resource_name`, line 73): user-controlled segments such as `C:` are accepted by `_secure_path`, and on Windows `join(self.norm_docroot, path)` treats the drive-qualified path as absolute. A request like `/static/C:/Windows/win.ini` therefore bypasses the docroot restriction and allows reading files anywhere on the filesystem.

3. The helper pipeline (`sanitize_path` → `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` → `path_to_filesystem`) aggressively normalizes the input, strips “.”/“..” segments, rejects multi-component or drive-qualified pieces, and raises on anything unsafe before joining with the base directory, so path traversal or similar filesystem exploits are effectively blocked.

3. The module simply re-exports Django’s built-in aggregate helpers with minor obfuscation. Expressions and delimiters are still passed through Django’s ORM, so values are parameterized by the framework rather than interpolated into SQL, and there are no direct file, network, or process operations that could introduce security risks.

2. - Broken access control – `provided_code.py:37`, `provided_code.py:62` – `simple_PSP_policy` and `promote_sp` trust the caller-supplied `incoming_sp`/`sp` data without any authentication or authorization checks, letting an unauthenticated actor register themselves as “online”, force the primary flag to `True`, and demote the legitimate provider. That enables an unauthorized takeover of the service provider role.  
   - Unsafe YAML handling – `provided_code.py:19-21` – `load_privilege` lets the caller pick any file path via `AUTHZ_FILE` and feeds it to `load_yaml`; NVFlare’s helper wraps PyYAML loading and will deserialize attacker-controlled YAML. A malicious file can therefore trigger object construction or leak arbitrary local files, yielding code execution or data exposure.
