2. - Denial of Service — `construct` (`construct`, lines 46-50): uses the built-in `tuple` type instead of the argument (`len(tuple)` / `tuple[i]`), which raises `TypeError` on every call, letting an attacker crash any code path that rebuilds a key from untrusted input.  
   - Denial of Service — `_verify` (`ElGamalobj._verify`, line 86): references an undefined global `p` instead of `self.p`, so any signature verification attempt raises `NameError`, allowing remote callers to crash the verifier rather than simply rejecting bad signatures.

2. - Vulnerability: Directory traversal / arbitrary file read  
    - Location: `static_view.py:54` (`resource_path = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path)))`) together with `_secure_path` (`static_view.py:96-101`)  
    - Reason: `_secure_path` only blocks `..`, `.`, empty segments, and separators, so a path element like `C:` (or another drive-root on Windows) passes validation. When such a segment is supplied in the request, `os.path.join` treats it as an absolute path and discards `self.norm_docroot`, letting attackers request files anywhere on the drive (`GET /C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` → serves that file).

2. - Type: Path traversal via symbolic links; Line: `path_to_filesystem:38`; Reason: After sanitizing segments, the code iteratively joins them with `os.path.join` but never resolves the final path or enforces that it still lies under `base_folder`. An attacker who can plant a symlink inside the allowed tree (e.g., `base_folder/uploads -> /`) can request a benign-looking path like `uploads/etc/passwd` and escape the intended root when the symlink is followed.

2. This module only defines aggregate helpers that rely on Django’s ORM parameterization; it neither executes external commands nor introduces unsanitized SQL, so there is no evident security risk in the provided code.

- vuln: Authorization fail-open — `load_privilege` returns `{}` on any load error without logging or aborting. If the privilege file is unreadable or malformed (which an attacker with env control or filesystem access can trigger), downstream checks may see “no restrictions” and grant unintended access. (`load_privilege`, `load_privilege` lines `load_privilege`:17-23)  
- vuln: Denial of service — `update_sp_state` blindly calls `datetime.fromisoformat(sp[""last_heartbeat""])`. A crafted store entry with a malformed or missing timestamp throws `ValueError`, taking down the refresh path and blocking heartbeat processing. (`update_sp_state`:25-33)  
- vuln: Denial of service — `promote_sp` trusts `get_primary_sp(project)` to return a record. When it returns `None`, the subsequent `all(current_psp[k] == v …)` dereference raises, so a crafted promotion request with no active primary causes the handler to crash. (`promote_sp`:62-77)
