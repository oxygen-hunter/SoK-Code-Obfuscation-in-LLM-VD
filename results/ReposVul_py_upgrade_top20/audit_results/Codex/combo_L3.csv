2. - Denial of Service – `ElGamalobj._verify` (around `if sig[0] < 1 or sig[0] > p-1`) – the code references `p` instead of `self.p`, so evaluating the range check raises a `NameError`. Any caller that supplies a signature (even a valid one) will trigger this exception, allowing an attacker to crash or hang the verification routine.

2. - Type: Directory traversal / arbitrary file read (high severity). Vulnerable lines: `static_view.get_resource_name` (`static.py`:53) where `normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path)))` is computed together with `_secure_path` (`static.py`:88-95). Reason: `_secure_path` fails to reject drive-letter segments like `C:` on Windows, so the joined path becomes an absolute path and escapes the intended docroot, letting an attacker request files such as `C:/Windows/win.ini`.

3. Each function enforces safe path handling: `sanitize_path` normalizes input, strips hazardous `.`/`..` segments, and rebuilds an absolute path, while `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` forbids multi-component, drive, or relative markers. `path_to_filesystem` only joins these validated components to the provided base, preventing traversal outside the intended directory.

3. These Django aggregate wrappers delegate to built-in database functions and rely on Django’s query parameterization; they do not process untrusted input or expose unsafe behaviors, so no security risk is apparent.

- Missing authentication/authorization (CWE-306/CWE-862) — `provided_code.py:18-26`, `provided_code.py:27-41`: `simple_PSP_policy()` and `promote_sp()` accept caller-supplied `incoming_sp`/`sp` data, update the service store, and even flip the `primary` flag plus session ID without any credential or signature check. An attacker who can reach these entry points can spoof a service endpoint, register it, and promote it to primary, hijacking the control plane.  
- Fail-open authorization on config load (CWE-703/CWE-306) — `provided_code.py:9-12`: `load_privilege()` wraps the YAML load in a bare `except` and returns an empty dict on any error. If the privilege file is missing or tampered with, the system falls back to “no policy,” likely disabling authorization checks entirely and enabling privilege escalation.  
- Denial of service via unvalidated primary lookup (CWE-754) — `provided_code.py:32-41`: `promote_sp()` assumes `get_primary_sp(project)` returns a dict; if it returns `None` (e.g., no current primary), the comprehension `current_psp[k]` raises, resulting in an unhandled exception. An attacker can trigger this state to crash or hang promotion handling.
