2. - Type: Weak cryptographic key generation; Lines: 12-15 (`generate`); Reason: the primality check recurses only when `obj.p` is prime, so the function stops on the first *non*-prime `p = 2q + 1`, emitting a composite modulus. Composite moduli let attackers factor `p`, collapse the discrete-log assumptions, and fully break ElGamal security.  
   - Type: Denial of service; Lines: 86 (`ElGamalobj._verify`); Reason: the range check references `p` instead of `self.p`, so verifying any signature raises a `NameError` and can crash callers that process untrusted signatures.

2. - Type: Null-byte injection leading to denial of service  
     Vulnerable lines: `pyramid/static.py:118` (`_invalid_element_chars = {'/', os.sep, '\\x00'}`) and `pyramid/static.py:120-126` (`_contains_invalid_element_char` / `_secure_path`)  
     Reason: The code tries to block null bytes by listing `'\\x00'`, which is the literal backslash-escape text, not the actual null character (`'\x00'`). A request path containing a real null byte therefore passes `_secure_path`, and downstream filesystem calls such as `os.path.exists()` raise `ValueError: embedded null character`, giving unauthenticated attackers a reliable 500 error route.

2. - Type: Denial of Service (stack exhaustion); Location: `sanitize_path` helper `recursive_join` (around sanitize_path lines 18-27) and `path_to_filesystem` helper `recursive_sanitization` (around path_to_filesystem lines 43-54); Reason: both helpers recurse once per path segment with no depth guard, so an attacker can supply a path containing >~1000 segments and trigger a `RecursionError`, taking the request handler down and enabling a DoS.

Reason: The module only defines Django aggregate helpers that rely on ORM parameter binding and type-safe field wrappers; it never performs direct SQL concatenation or other unsafe handling of user-controlled input.

2. - Type: Denial of Service (stack exhaustion) | Location `code_snippet.py:34` | Reason: `process_sp` recurses once per service provider; an attacker creating >~1000 SP entries (e.g., by repeatedly invoking `simple_PSP_policy` with new `sp_end_point` values) will exceed Python’s recursion limit and raise `RecursionError`, crashing the overseer process.
   - Type: Denial of Service (uncaught exception) | Location `code_snippet.py:90` | Reason: `promote_sp` assumes `get_primary_sp(project)` always returns a record; when no primary exists (common for a fresh project) it returns `None`, and the `all(current_psp[k] == v …)` dereference triggers a `TypeError` that propagates and can be triggered on demand to kill the handler.
