      - Type: Denial-of-service (crash on signature verification); Lines: original/11_ElGamal.py:343; Reason: _verify      
        compares sig[0] against p, but p is undefined in this scope. Any call to verify a signature raises NameError,      
        letting an attacker (or even a valid signature) crash processes that rely on this check.

YES
- Directory traversal / arbitrary file read; original/14_static.py:134 + original/14_static.py:152 – _secure_path only   
    rejects .., ., empty segments, path separators, and NUL bytes, so a segment like C: passes. On Windows this makes      
    _secure_path return C:/…; when join(self.norm_docroot, path) runs, the drive-qualified path is treated as absolute,    
    escaping the static root. A request for /C:/windows/system32/... would therefore serve files outside the intended      
    directory.

3. `sanitize_path` normalizes incoming values to an absolute POSIX form while dropping `"".""` and `""..""`, `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` rejects multi-component, drive-letter, or dot/dotdot segments, and `path_to_filesystem` only joins these vetted components under the supplied `base_folder`, so directory traversal or cross-drive access are prevented.

3. These aggregates mirror Django’s built-in PostgreSQL aggregates and delegate all SQL generation to Django’s ORM, which parameterizes inputs and prevents injection; no insecure data handling or other vulnerabilities are evident.

3. The snippet only routes between pre-defined storage backends, loads privileges via NVFLARE’s `load_yaml` helper (which relies on `yaml.safe_load`), and updates in-memory service-provider records; there is no code path that executes or evaluates user-controlled input, performs insecure deserialization, or exposes another injection surface.
