2. - Denial of Service (unhandled exception) – lines 51-55: `construct` mistakenly uses the built-in `tuple` instead of the `tup` argument, so calling `construct` (e.g., via `publickey()`) raises a `TypeError`, letting an attacker crash the service.  
   - Denial of Service (unhandled exception) – lines 98-101: `_verify` compares against `p`, which is undefined; the first verification attempt raises a `NameError`, so any signature check can be used to terminate the process.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Type: Path Traversal / Arbitrary File Read (Windows) | Lines: `static_view.py:48` (`resource_path = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path)))`), `static_view.py:113` (`_contains_invalid_element_char`) | Reason: `_secure_path` allows a segment like `C:` because `_contains_invalid_element_char` only rejects `/`, `\`, and the literal string `\x00`. On Windows, a request such as `/C:/Windows/system.ini` produces the tuple `('C:', 'Windows', 'system.ini')`, which `_secure_path` accepts. When that value is joined with `self.norm_docroot`, the absolute drive path causes `os.path.join` to ignore the configured docroot, letting the handler serve any readable file on the server disk.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

2. - Denial of Service via unhandled exception — `code_snippet.py:39` — `datetime.fromisoformat(sp[""last_heartbeat""])` runs on data fetched from the store with no validation or error handling; a malicious or corrupted entry lacking `last_heartbeat` or using a non-ISO value will raise an exception and crash the service loop.
   - Denial of Service via null dereference — `code_snippet.py:97` — when no primary SP exists, `current_psp = get_primary_sp(project)` returns `None`, yet the subsequent `all(current_psp[k] == v for k, v in sp.items())` dereferences it, raising a `TypeError` that can be triggered remotely and halt processing.
