2. - Cryptographic implementation flaw – `snippet.py:20-31`: the generator validation is effectively disabled because every attempt to clear `safe` uses the C-style operators `||`/`&&`, which are never evaluated in Python. As a result the loop breaks on the first random `g`, so values such as `g = 1` are accepted. With `g = 1` the ciphertext becomes `(a=1, b=M)`, fully exposing the plaintext and enabling trivial small-subgroup attacks on the private key.
   - Denial of service – `snippet.py:63`: `_verify()` references `p` instead of `self.p`. Any call that reaches this branch raises a `NameError`, letting an attacker crash the verifier (or any service that depends on it) with a crafted signature query.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Path traversal / arbitrary file read (`static_view.get_resource_name`, line 73): user-controlled segments such as `C:` are accepted by `_secure_path`, and on Windows `join(self.norm_docroot, path)` treats the drive-qualified path as absolute. A request like `/static/C:/Windows/win.ini` therefore bypasses the docroot restriction and allows reading files anywhere on the filesystem.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

3. The helper pipeline (`sanitize_path` → `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` → `path_to_filesystem`) aggressively normalizes the input, strips “.”/“..” segments, rejects multi-component or drive-qualified pieces, and raises on anything unsafe before joining with the base directory, so path traversal or similar filesystem exploits are effectively blocked.

3. The module simply re-exports Django’s built-in aggregate helpers with minor obfuscation. Expressions and delimiters are still passed through Django’s ORM, so values are parameterized by the framework rather than interpolated into SQL, and there are no direct file, network, or process operations that could introduce security risks.
","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

2. - Broken access control – `provided_code.py:37`, `provided_code.py:62` – `simple_PSP_policy` and `promote_sp` trust the caller-supplied `incoming_sp`/`sp` data without any authentication or authorization checks, letting an unauthenticated actor register themselves as “online”, force the primary flag to `True`, and demote the legitimate provider. That enables an unauthorized takeover of the service provider role.  
   - Unsafe YAML handling – `provided_code.py:19-21` – `load_privilege` lets the caller pick any file path via `AUTHZ_FILE` and feeds it to `load_yaml`; NVFlare’s helper wraps PyYAML loading and will deserialize attacker-controlled YAML. A malicious file can therefore trigger object construction or leak arbitrary local files, yielding code execution or data exposure.

CVE Description: NVFLARE, versions prior to 2.1.2, contains a vulnerability in its utils module, where YAML files are loaded via yaml.load() instead of yaml.safe_load().
