2. - Denial of Service – `construct`:41,43,45. The function mistakenly references the builtin `tuple` instead of the `tup` argument, so `len(tuple)` raises a `TypeError` and `publickey()` (which calls `construct`) will crash; an attacker can trigger this to halt the service.  
   - Denial of Service – `_verify`:80. The range check uses an undefined variable `p`; any call to verify a signature throws a `NameError`, letting an attacker cause the verifier to abort.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"1. YES
2. - Path traversal / arbitrary file read — `static_view.py:63` (`static_view.get_resource_name`) and `static_view.py:121` (`_secure_path`) — `_secure_path` only filters `..`, `.`, empty segments, and a few characters, so a segment such as `C:` is accepted. When the resulting `resource_name` (`C:/Windows/win.ini`, for example) is joined with `self.norm_docroot`, `os.path.join` treats it as an absolute Windows path and returns it verbatim. Because no subsequent check ensures the final path still resides under the configured document root, an attacker can request URLs like `/C:/Windows/win.ini` and the static view will serve files outside the intended directory.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. - Vulnerability Type: Path traversal / filesystem escape; Vulnerable Lines: `path.py:32` (`if components[0]: return components[0]`); Reason: On Windows, `os.path.splitdrive` returns a drive string such as `C:`. Returning that string makes `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` appear “truthy”, so `path_to_filesystem` treats `C:` as safe. `os.path.join(base, ""C:"")` then discards the intended base directory, allowing an attacker to translate a user-controlled path like `C:/Windows/system.ini` outside the Radicale storage root.

3. The code only defines subclasses of Django’s aggregate functions without handling user input or performing security-sensitive operations, and it consistently relies on Django’s safe abstractions (e.g., `Value(str(b))` in `StringAgg`), so no exploitable vulnerability is evident.
","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
