2. - Type: Denial of Service. Location: `ElGamalobj._verify`, line containing `if sig[0]<1 or sig[0]>p-1:`. Reason: the code references `p` instead of `self.p`, so any signature verification attempt raises a `NameError`, allowing an attacker to crash the verifier.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Path traversal / arbitrary file read – obscure_static_view.py:49, obscure_static_view.py:109 – `secure_path` only strips separators and dot segments, so a Windows-style segment such as `C:` survives; when `resolve_resource_name` later calls `combine_path`, that drive-qualified segment is treated as absolute, allowing requests to escape the intended docroot and retrieve any readable file.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

3. The helper functions normalize and sanitize user-controlled paths, rejecting any component that would introduce traversal (`.`/`..`), drive letters, UNC prefixes, or embedded separators before joining it with the base directory. This prevents escaping the intended base path, so no obvious security vulnerabilities are evident in the provided snippet.

3. The snippet simply defines Django aggregate helper classes. They rely on Django’s ORM templating and `Value` objects, which handle SQL parameterization and escaping. There’s no direct handling of untrusted data or unsafe operations, so no evident security vulnerabilities.
","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
