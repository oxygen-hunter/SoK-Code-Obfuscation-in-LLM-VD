- Timing side-channel (snippet.py:64-65) – Decryption raises `pow(ciphertext[0], self.OX2A1C3B4D, self.OX7D3C2B1A)` and `inverse(...)` on values derived from the private key. CPython’s modular exponentiation/inversion are data-dependent, letting an observer recover key bits from timing or power traces.
- Insecure nonce handling (snippet.py:57, snippet.py:67-78) – `OXA6B5C4D3` and `OXC5B4A3D2` require callers to supply the ElGamal ephemeral `k` without generating or validating it. Reusing/predicting `k` makes encryption deterministic and exposes the private signing key.
- Ciphertext malleability (snippet.py:57-66) – Raw ElGamal encryption returns `(g^k, m·y^k mod p)` with no integrity check, so attackers can scale `m` by altering `c2` while keeping a valid ciphertext; the code offers no authentication to prevent this.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Vulnerability: Path traversal → arbitrary file read/exfiltration  
     Vulnerable lines: `code_snippet.py:40`, `code_snippet.py:52` (class `OX54B4F6C4`, method `OX6D3F1E8B`)  
     Reason: The handler builds the filesystem path for the response directly from `request.subpath`/`traversal_path_info`, joining it with the static root via `os.path.join`/string concatenation and then immediately serving it with `FileResponse`. No canonicalization check verifies that the normalized result still resides beneath `self.OX6B0EFD71`, and no segment filtering runs (the cached sanitizer `OX3A6F2D7B` is never invoked). An attacker can supply `..` segments (e.g., `/static/../../etc/passwd`) to escape the intended directory and read arbitrary files that the Pyramid process can access, defeating the static root boundary.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

Reason: `OX3B9C7F22` (lines 4-13) normalizes incoming POSIX paths and strips `.`/`..` segments, `OX5E9F3C7A` (lines 14-25) rejects any path element containing drive letters or directory separators, and `OX7F2C5A9E` (lines 26-36) joins only those validated segments—raising `ValueError` for anything unsafe—so the code prevents path traversal or filesystem breakout.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

- Improper authorization handling (lines 19-23): `OX5C6D7E8F` wraps `load_yaml` in a bare `except` and falls back to an empty dict. If the authz file is missing, unreadable, or maliciously malformed, the exception is swallowed and the function silently returns `{}`. Downstream checks will operate with no privileges configured, effectively disabling authorization and enabling privilege escalation.
