2. - Denial of Service — `construct` (`construct`, lines 46-50): uses the built-in `tuple` type instead of the argument (`len(tuple)` / `tuple[i]`), which raises `TypeError` on every call, letting an attacker crash any code path that rebuilds a key from untrusted input.  
   - Denial of Service — `_verify` (`ElGamalobj._verify`, line 86): references an undefined global `p` instead of `self.p`, so any signature verification attempt raises `NameError`, allowing remote callers to crash the verifier rather than simply rejecting bad signatures.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

CWE Description:

14_static.py,"1. YES  
2. - Vulnerability: Directory traversal / arbitrary file read  
    - Location: `static_view.py:54` (`resource_path = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path)))`) together with `_secure_path` (`static_view.py:96-101`)  
    - Reason: `_secure_path` only blocks `..`, `.`, empty segments, and separators, so a path element like `C:` (or another drive-root on Windows) passes validation. When such a segment is supplied in the request, `os.path.join` treats it as an absolute path and discards `self.norm_docroot`, letting attackers request files anywhere on the drive (`GET /C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` → serves that file).
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. - Type: Path traversal via symbolic links; Line: `path_to_filesystem:38`; Reason: After sanitizing segments, the code iteratively joins them with `os.path.join` but never resolves the final path or enforces that it still lies under `base_folder`. An attacker who can plant a symlink inside the allowed tree (e.g., `base_folder/uploads -> /`) can request a benign-looking path like `uploads/etc/passwd` and escape the intended root when the symlink is followed.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

- vuln: Authorization fail-open — `load_privilege` returns `{}` on any load error without logging or aborting. If the privilege file is unreadable or malformed (which an attacker with env control or filesystem access can trigger), downstream checks may see “no restrictions” and grant unintended access. (`load_privilege`, `load_privilege` lines `load_privilege`:17-23)  
- vuln: Denial of service — `update_sp_state` blindly calls `datetime.fromisoformat(sp[""last_heartbeat""])`. A crafted store entry with a malformed or missing timestamp throws `ValueError`, taking down the refresh path and blocking heartbeat processing. (`update_sp_state`:25-33)  
- vuln: Denial of service — `promote_sp` trusts `get_primary_sp(project)` to return a record. When it returns `None`, the subsequent `all(current_psp[k] == v …)` dereference raises, so a crafted promotion request with no active primary causes the handler to crash. (`promote_sp`:62-77)
