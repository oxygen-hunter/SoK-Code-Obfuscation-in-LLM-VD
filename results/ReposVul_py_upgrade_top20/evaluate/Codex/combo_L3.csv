2. - Denial of Service – `ElGamalobj._verify` (around `if sig[0] < 1 or sig[0] > p-1`) – the code references `p` instead of `self.p`, so evaluating the range check raises a `NameError`. Any caller that supplies a signature (even a valid one) will trigger this exception, allowing an attacker to crash or hang the verification routine.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"1. YES  
2. - Type: Directory traversal / arbitrary file read (high severity). Vulnerable lines: `static_view.get_resource_name` (`static.py`:53) where `normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path)))` is computed together with `_secure_path` (`static.py`:88-95). Reason: `_secure_path` fails to reject drive-letter segments like `C:` on Windows, so the joined path becomes an absolute path and escapes the intended docroot, letting an attacker request files such as `C:/Windows/win.ini`.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

3. Each function enforces safe path handling: `sanitize_path` normalizes input, strips hazardous `.`/`..` segments, and rebuilds an absolute path, while `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` forbids multi-component, drive, or relative markers. `path_to_filesystem` only joins these validated components to the provided base, preventing traversal outside the intended directory.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

- Missing authentication/authorization (CWE-306/CWE-862) — `provided_code.py:18-26`, `provided_code.py:27-41`: `simple_PSP_policy()` and `promote_sp()` accept caller-supplied `incoming_sp`/`sp` data, update the service store, and even flip the `primary` flag plus session ID without any credential or signature check. An attacker who can reach these entry points can spoof a service endpoint, register it, and promote it to primary, hijacking the control plane.  
- Fail-open authorization on config load (CWE-703/CWE-306) — `provided_code.py:9-12`: `load_privilege()` wraps the YAML load in a bare `except` and returns an empty dict on any error. If the privilege file is missing or tampered with, the system falls back to “no policy,” likely disabling authorization checks entirely and enabling privilege escalation.  
- Denial of service via unvalidated primary lookup (CWE-754) — `provided_code.py:32-41`: `promote_sp()` assumes `get_primary_sp(project)` returns a dict; if it returns `None` (e.g., no current primary), the comprehension `current_psp[k]` raises, resulting in an unhandled exception. An attacker can trigger this state to crash or hang promotion handling.
