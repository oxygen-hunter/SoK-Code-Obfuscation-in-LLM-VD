2. - Type: Weak cryptographic key generation; Lines: 12-15 (`generate`); Reason: the primality check recurses only when `obj.p` is prime, so the function stops on the first *non*-prime `p = 2q + 1`, emitting a composite modulus. Composite moduli let attackers factor `p`, collapse the discrete-log assumptions, and fully break ElGamal security.  
   - Type: Denial of service; Lines: 86 (`ElGamalobj._verify`); Reason: the range check references `p` instead of `self.p`, so verifying any signature raises a `NameError` and can crash callers that process untrusted signatures.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"1. YES
2. - Type: Null-byte injection leading to denial of service  
     Vulnerable lines: `pyramid/static.py:118` (`_invalid_element_chars = {'/', os.sep, '\\x00'}`) and `pyramid/static.py:120-126` (`_contains_invalid_element_char` / `_secure_path`)  
     Reason: The code tries to block null bytes by listing `'\\x00'`, which is the literal backslash-escape text, not the actual null character (`'\x00'`). A request path containing a real null byte therefore passes `_secure_path`, and downstream filesystem calls such as `os.path.exists()` raise `ValueError: embedded null character`, giving unauthenticated attackers a reliable 500 error route.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

116_utils.py,"1. YES
2. - Type: Denial of Service (stack exhaustion) | Location `code_snippet.py:34` | Reason: `process_sp` recurses once per service provider; an attacker creating >~1000 SP entries (e.g., by repeatedly invoking `simple_PSP_policy` with new `sp_end_point` values) will exceed Python’s recursion limit and raise `RecursionError`, crashing the overseer process.
   - Type: Denial of Service (uncaught exception) | Location `code_snippet.py:90` | Reason: `promote_sp` assumes `get_primary_sp(project)` always returns a record; when no primary exists (common for a fresh project) it returns `None`, and the `all(current_psp[k] == v …)` dereference triggers a `TypeError` that propagates and can be triggered on demand to kill the handler.
