2. - Denial of Service — `python_elgamal.py:28-32` — `construct` mistakenly uses the built-in `tuple` instead of the `tup` argument, so `len(tuple)` throws a `TypeError`. Any call such as `publickey()` triggers this crash, letting an attacker stop key handling.
   - Denial of Service — `python_elgamal.py:68-69` — `_verify` compares `sig[0]` against an undefined `p`, raising a `NameError`. Malicious input to signature verification can therefore knock the service offline.
   - Cryptographic Implementation Flaw — `ElGamal.sol:26-30` — `sign` attempts to invert `K mod (p-1)` via `expmod(K, p1-2, p1)`. Because `p-1` is composite, Fermat’s trick is invalid, so most signatures are malformed and will not verify, breaking integrity and allowing trivial disruption.
   - Cryptographic Implementation Flaw — `ElGamal.sol:17-21` — `decrypt` uses exponent `p-3` when trying to invert `ax`, yielding `ax⁻²` instead of `ax⁻¹`. Decryption outputs garbage, destroying confidentiality/availability of the encrypted data.
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"YES  
- DoS / Null dereference – `StaticView::normpath` (`static_view` class, around `char* real_path = realpath(path.c_str(), nullptr);`): `realpath` returns `nullptr` whenever the input path is invalid, inaccessible, or the process lacks permission. The code immediately constructs `std::string normalized(real_path);` without checking for `nullptr`, so an attacker who can feed an invalid `root_dir` (e.g., via configuration or request routing) can trigger a crash and take the service down.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. - Denial of Service (crash) — `sanitizePath` `path.back()` (`sanitizePath` line 13): calling `std::string::back()` on an empty string is undefined behaviour; an attacker can send an empty path and crash the process.  
   - Denial of Service (uncaught exception) — `sanitizePath` canonical call (`sanitizePath` line 15): `boost::filesystem::canonical()` throws `filesystem_error` for paths that do not exist or cannot be resolved; with untrusted input this propagates out of the function and terminates the program, allowing an attacker to take the service down.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
