      - Type: Denial-of-service (crash on signature verification); Lines: original/11_ElGamal.py:343; Reason: _verify      
        compares sig[0] against p, but p is undefined in this scope. Any call to verify a signature raises NameError,      
        letting an attacker (or even a valid signature) crash processes that rely on this check.  
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"
YES
- Directory traversal / arbitrary file read; original/14_static.py:134 + original/14_static.py:152 – _secure_path only   
    rejects .., ., empty segments, path separators, and NUL bytes, so a segment like C: passes. On Windows this makes      
    _secure_path return C:/…; when join(self.norm_docroot, path) runs, the drive-qualified path is treated as absolute,    
    escaping the static root. A request for /C:/windows/system32/... would therefore serve files outside the intended      
    directory. 
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

3. `sanitize_path` normalizes incoming values to an absolute POSIX form while dropping `"".""` and `""..""`, `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` rejects multi-component, drive-letter, or dot/dotdot segments, and `path_to_filesystem` only joins these vetted components under the supplied `base_folder`, so directory traversal or cross-drive access are prevented.

3. These aggregates mirror Django’s built-in PostgreSQL aggregates and delegate all SQL generation to Django’s ORM, which parameterizes inputs and prevents injection; no insecure data handling or other vulnerabilities are evident.
","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
