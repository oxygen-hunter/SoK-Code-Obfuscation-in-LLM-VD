2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Insecure Random Number Generation:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Throughout the code, functions like `number.getRandomRange` and `number.getRandomInteger` are used.
     - **Reason:** The PyCrypto library's random number generation functions may not be suitable for modern cryptographic standards. They might not use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG), which is essential for generating secure keys and nonces.

   - **Use of Obsolete Library:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Importing from `Crypto.PublicKey.pubkey` and using PyCrypto functions.
     - **Reason:** PyCrypto is an outdated library with known security issues and maintenance problems. It's recommended to use more modern and maintained libraries like `cryptography`.

   - **Potential Weak Key Generation:**
","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. **Vulnerabilities Detected:**

   - **Path Traversal Vulnerability:**
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Various methods where file paths are constructed using user input, such as in `OX6D3","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. **Vulnerability Type**: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Throughout the code, especially in the path normalization and validation functions.  
   - **Reason**: While the code attempts to sanitize paths by normalizing and checking each component, there might be edge cases, such as different operating systems or Unicode normalization, that aren't adequately handled, potentially allowing path traversal attacks.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

2. **Reason**: The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. It uses Django's built-in features correctly, avoiding unsafe SQL practices and ensuring proper escaping of variables. The use of Django's ORM and built-in fields helps mitigate common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
