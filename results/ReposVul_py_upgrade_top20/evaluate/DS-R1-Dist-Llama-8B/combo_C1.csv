CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']
CWE Description: 
",1.0,702.0,6.0,0.81890869140625
14_static.py,"1. **Is the code vulnerable?** NO.
2. **Why?** The code includes a path sanitization function `_secure_path` that checks for common path traversal attempts by rejecting paths containing `..`, `.`, or invalid characters. Additionally, it doesn't have any obvious vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF issues based on the provided code.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.
CWE: ['CWE-22']

",1.0,931.0,6.0,0.8182969093322754
55_pathutils.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** NO
2. **Reason:** The code contains functions designed to sanitize and validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. It checks each path component and skips over '.' and '..'. The presence of dummy functions within the code does not introduce vulnerabilities as they are never executed. The code properly constructs safe file paths relative to a base folder, ensuring that only valid, safe components are used.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505
CVE Description: The filesystem storage backend in Radicale before 1.1 on Windows allows remote attackers to read or write to arbitrary files via a crafted path, as demonstrated by /c:/file/ignore.

111_general.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities:**  
   - **Potential SQL Injection Risk in BitAnd and BitOr Classes**  
     - **Lines:** BitAnd class, BitOr class  
     - **Reason:** The `_ignored_method` in BitAnd and BitOr returns 'ignored' when certain conditions are met. If this method is used to bypass security checks or validations, it could potentially allow unintended database operations, leading to SQL injection or other security issues.  
   - **Potential Data Handling Issue in ArrayAgg, JSONBAgg, and StringAgg Classes**  
     - **Lines:** ArrayAgg, JSONBAgg, StringAgg classes  
     - **Reason:** The `convert_value` methods return `None` when the value isn't convertible. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as returning `None` instead of an empty list or string, which might cause issues in downstream processing or display, potentially leading to application crashes or incorrect data handling.  

3. **Why Not Vulnerable:** The code doesn't directly expose SQL injection points or obvious security flaws. The primary concerns are the `ignored` flag and the handling of `None` in data conversion, which could lead to issues if not properly managed.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

2. **Reason:** The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, or insecure file operations. It uses environment variables and standard libraries in a secure manner. The potential risks are mitigated by the controlled use of these elements and the lack of direct security flaws in the visible code.","CVE: CVE-2022-31605
