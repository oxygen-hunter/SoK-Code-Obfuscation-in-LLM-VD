   - **Type**: Cryptographic vulnerability (Inverse operation without validation)  
   - **Lines**: decrypt method, lines 28-29  
   - **Reason**: The `decrypt` method uses `number.inverse` without checking if the number is coprime with the modulus. This can lead to exceptions or incorrect results when the inverse doesn't exist, which could affect the decryption process.

CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']
CWE Description: 
",2.0,762.0,6.0,0.6555523872375488
14_static.py,"1. **Vulnerable or Not**: YES
2. **Vulnerabilities Type**: Path Traversal
3. **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines 52-63 in `static_view.py` (get_resource_name method)
4. **Reason**: The code constructs resource paths without properly validating against path traversal attacks, allowing attackers to access unintended files or directories.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Path Construction**: The `get_resource_name` method constructs `resource_path` by joining `self.docroot` with `path` from the request. This can be manipulated if `path` contains directory traversal sequences like '..' or '.'.
- **Path Validation**: The `_secure_path` function checks for invalid characters but may not correctly handle all path traversal vectors, especially when `path_tuple` contains '..' or '.'.
- **Potential Exploit**: An attacker can provide a malicious path that navigates beyond the intended directory, exposing sensitive files or allowing access to unintended resources.

**Fixes:**

1. **Improve Path Validation**: Use a more robust path validation function that correctly handles all path traversal elements.
2. **Sanitize Input Paths**: Ensure all user-controlled paths are sanitized before use.
3. **Use Safe Path Functions**: Utilize functions like `os.path.relpath` or similar that handle normalization and prevent traversal.

**Conclusion**: The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient path validation, allowing attackers to access unintended files or directories.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

   - **Global Variable Access**: The code accesses global variables like `globals()['function']` and `globals()['allow_distinct']`. This can lead to potential code injection or unintended modifications if these variables are not properly controlled.  
   - **Missing Input Sanitization**: The `convert_value` methods in `ArrayAgg` and `StringAgg` return raw values without proper sanitization, which could allow injection of malicious data.
