CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

55_pathutils.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Path Sanitization Issue**: The function `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` incorrectly handles paths with drive letters (e.g., ""C:\"" on Windows), leading to potential false negatives.  
   - **Unsanitized Base Folder**: The `path_to_filesystem` function does not sanitize the `base_folder`, which could allow path traversal if not properly controlled.  
3. **Reasoning**:  
   - **Path Component Check**: The function `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` returns `False` for paths containing drive letters, which are valid on Windows. This can cause valid paths to be rejected, potentially leading to errors or blocked access.  
   - **Missing Sanitization of Base Folder**: The `base_folder` in `path_to_filesystem` isn't sanitized, allowing it to potentially contain malicious paths that could be used for traversal if not properly validated.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

2. **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection  
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `StringAgg` class, specifically the `__init__` method where `delimiter` is used without sanitization.  
   - **Reason**: The `delimiter` parameter in `StringAgg` is used in a string context without proper escaping, allowing potential SQL injection if the delimiter is controlled by an untrusted source. This can lead to malicious SQL queries being executed.  
3. **Explanation**: The `delimiter` parameter in `StringAgg` is passed directly into a string context, which can be exploited to inject SQL commands if not properly sanitized. This poses a risk of SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
