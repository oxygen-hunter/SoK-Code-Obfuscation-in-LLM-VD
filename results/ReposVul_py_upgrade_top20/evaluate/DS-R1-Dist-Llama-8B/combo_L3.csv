11_ElGamal.py,"The code has a security vulnerability related to prime generation.

1. **Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Prime Generation.
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: `q = bignum(getPrime(bits-1, randfunc))`
   - **Reason**: The `getPrime` function is called with `bits-1` instead of `bits`, which can result in a prime number that is one bit shorter than intended. This may lead to weaker keys and potential security issues.

**Answer:**

1. **Vulnerable**: YES
2. **Vulnerability","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

   - **Path Traversal Vulnerability**: The code may allow path traversal due to improper validation in `_secure_path` and reliance on `resource_exists`.
   - **Vulnerable Lines**: Lines where `resource_exists` and `isdir` are used in `get_resource_name` and `find_resource_path`.
","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. **Reason:** The code includes proper checks for path traversal attempts by skipping `.` and `..` components and normalizing paths, which prevents common security issues. Each path component is validated to ensure it's safe for the filesystem. The functions use platform-independent path handling, reducing potential vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

2. **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection  
   - **Lines:** `StringAgg` class, `__init__` and `convert_value` methods.  
   - **Reason:** The `delimiter` is stored as a raw string without escaping, allowing injection of malicious SQL characters. When `convert_value` returns the concatenated string, it can lead to SQL injection.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

116_utils.py,"The code contains several security vulnerabilities:

1. **YAML Deserialization Vulnerability**: The `load_privilege` function loads a YAML file without proper sanitization, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
2. **Missing Input Validation**: The `simple_PSP_policy` and `promote_sp` functions lack validation, allowing potential tampering with SP data.
3. **Print Statements**: Exposing internal states via print statements can leak information.
4. **Lack of Authentication**: Critical functions lack auth checks, risking unauthorized access.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **YAML Deserialization Vulnerability (Line 10-12)**: The `load_yaml` function can execute arbitrary code, posing a risk if the YAML file is compromised.
- **Input Validation Issues (Lines 28-30, 52-53)**: Missing checks in `simple_PSP_policy` and `promote_sp` allow malicious SP data tampering.
- **Print Statements (Lines 34, 37, 43)**: Leak internal information, not suitable for production.
- **Missing Authentication (Lines 1-5, 28-30)**: Critical functions lack auth checks, risking unauthorized access.

**Recommendation**: Implement proper YAML sanitization, add input validation, replace print statements with appropriate logging, and enforce authentication in critical functions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2022-31605
CVE Description: NVFLARE, versions prior to 2.1.2, contains a vulnerability in its utils module, where YAML files are loaded via yaml.load() instead of yaml.safe_load(). The deserialization of Untrusted Data, may allow an unprivileged network attacker to cause Remote Code Execution, Denial Of Service, and Impact to both Confidentiality and Integrity.
