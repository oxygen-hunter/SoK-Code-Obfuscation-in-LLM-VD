11_ElGamal.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. The vulnerabilities are:  
   - The manipulation of unused variables in the generate and construct functions, which could introduce a backdoor or hidden functionality.  
   - The improper range check in the _verify method, allowing invalid signatures to pass through.  
   - Reason: These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to potentially exploit the system by introducing unintended behavior or forging signatures.","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']
CWE Description: 
",2.0,713.0,6.0,1.3355863094329834
14_static.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerability Type**: Directory Traversal (due to improper use of `lru_cache` decorator)  
3. **Vulnerable Lines**: The `_secure_path` method is decorated with `@lru_cache`, which caches the results of security checks. This can prevent necessary security checks from being performed again, allowing attackers to bypass security measures such as directory traversal.  
4. **Reason**: The use of `lru_cache` on the `_secure_path` method may store the result of security checks, potentially allowing attackers to bypass these checks if they can exploit the caching mechanism.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.
CWE: ['CWE-22']
CWE Description: 
",2.0,991.0,6.0,0.9122705459594728
55_pathutils.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerability type: Path Concatenation Attack  
   Vulnerable lines:  
   - sanitize_path() function: The use of os.path.join could lead to incorrect path concatenation if base_folder is relative and parts are not absolute.  
   - path_to_filesystem() function: The base_folder might be relative, leading to incorrect file system traversal.  
   Reason: The code does not ensure that the base_folder is an absolute path, which can lead to unauthorized access if parts are added to a relative path.  
3. If unsure, the reason remains the same.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

111_general.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES

2. **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection Risk

   - **Vulnerable Lines**: The custom aggregate functions (ArrayAgg, BitAnd, BitOr, BoolAnd, BoolOr, JSONBAgg, StringAgg) inherit from Django's `Aggregate` class but do not properly override the `convert_value` method to ensure parameter sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the values passed to these functions are not properly escaped.

   - **Reason**: Custom aggregate functions in Django need to handle parameter sanitization to prevent SQL injection. The provided code does not implement this, potentially allowing malicious input to be injected into the SQL queries.

3. **Explanation**: Django's ORM provides built-in protections against SQL injection, but custom aggregate functions can bypass these protections. Without proper sanitization in the `convert_value` method, the ORM does not prevent malicious parameter injection, increasing the risk of SQL injection attacks.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
CWE: ['CWE-89']
CWE Description: 
",3.0,883.0,6.0,1.228950262069702
116_utils.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - **Dictionary-based lookups**: The code uses `get_sp_by` with a dictionary, which is insecure as it allows for key injection attacks. An attacker could bypass security by providing malicious keys.
   - **Heartbeat timeout handling**: The `heartbeat_timeout` is hardcoded to 10 seconds, which might not account for time zone differences or server clock issues, potentially causing SPs to be incorrectly marked offline.
   - **Lack of input validation**: The code does not validate incoming SPs before processing, leading to potential undefined behavior or remote code execution if data is manipulated.
   - **Print statements for logging**: While not a direct security vulnerability, print statements are not secure for production logging and should be replaced with logging libraries to prevent sensitive information exposure.

3. Reason: The code has multiple security risks including potential key injection, improper handling of time-related data, lack of input validation, and insecure logging practices. These vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or cause system instability.","CVE: CVE-2022-31605
