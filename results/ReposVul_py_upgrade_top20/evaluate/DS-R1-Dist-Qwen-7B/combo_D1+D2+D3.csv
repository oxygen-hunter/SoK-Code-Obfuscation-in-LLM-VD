CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']
CWE Description: 
",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
14_static.py,"1. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - **Deprecation of `resource_exists` and `resource_filename`:** The code uses deprecated functions from `pkg_resources`, which could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior in future versions.
   - **Cache Exhaustion Risk:** The `lru_cache` decorator with a maxsize of 1000 might cause cache exhaustion if the same paths are accessed frequently, leading to performance degradation.
   - **Path Handling:** While the `_secure_path` function prevents directory traversal, the use of `os.path.join` with relative paths could lead to incorrect path resolutions if not properly managed.

2. **Security Recommendations:**
   - **Update Deprecated Functions:** Replace `resource_exists` and `resource_filename` with their newer counterparts or use alternative methods to ensure compatibility and avoid potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Optimize Cache Management:** Increase the cache size or implement a more robust caching strategy to prevent exhaustion and ensure security.
   - **Enhance Path Validation:** Ensure that path resolution logic is thoroughly tested to handle edge cases and prevent any unintended path traversal.

3. **Conclusion:**
   The code has potential vulnerabilities related to deprecated modules and cache management. Updating these components and enhancing path validation can mitigate security","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

",2.0,1107.0,6.0,0.8583328723907471
55_pathutils.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. The vulnerabilities are due to issues in the `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function, which incorrectly uses flawed conditions leading to improper validation of filesystem path components. This can result in accepting unsafe paths or rejecting safe ones, potentially allowing directory traversal or injection attacks.  
3. The vulnerabilities arise because the conditions in `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` are incorrect, causing the function to not properly validate each path component. This can lead to incorrect handling of paths, allowing attackers to manipulate filesystem paths in unintended ways.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

111_general.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **ArrayAgg:** The `allow_distinct` method returns a boolean expression instead of a boolean, which can lead to incorrect behavior when using this aggregate function.
   - **StringAgg:** The `allow_distinct` method returns a boolean expression instead of a boolean, similar to ArrayAgg, which can cause issues in aggregation.
   - **JSONBAgg:** The `convert_value` method returns a list instead of a JSON object, which may not serialize correctly in the database. Additionally, handling `None` by returning an empty list might not be appropriate for JSON data.
3. **Reason:** The use of boolean expressions in `allow_distinct` and improper handling of `None` values in JSON aggregation can lead to incorrect query results or data issues.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
