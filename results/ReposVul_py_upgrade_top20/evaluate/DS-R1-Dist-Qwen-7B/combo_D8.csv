CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.
CWE: ['CWE-22']
CWE Description: 
",1.0,899.0,6.0,0.9145164489746094
55_pathutils.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
   - **Path Traversal**: The `base_folder` is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to construct paths that traverse directories.  
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The `base_folder` could be derived from user input, enabling attacks.  
   - **Insecure Path Components**: The `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function might not cover all unsafe components, potentially allowing dangerous paths.  
   - **Trailing Slash Handling**: The method of adding trailing slashes could lead to unintended directory traversal.  
3. Reason: The code lacks proper sanitization and validation of path components, making it susceptible to attacks that exploit uncontrolled paths.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

111_general.py,"1. **Vulnerable**: YES  
2. **Vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Injection Vulnerability**: The `convert_value` methods in `ArrayAgg`, `JSONBAgg`, and `StringAgg` classes return `[]` or `''` when `value` is `None`, which could lead to injection of malicious data if not properly validated.  
   - **SQL Injection Risk**: Using these aggregates in untrusted contexts without parameterization can execute SQL queries with untrusted data.  
   - **Incorrect Handling of None Values**: The `convert_value` methods may mishandle `None` values, potentially leading to incorrect data handling or errors.  

The vulnerabilities arise from the lack of input validation and potential untrusted data execution when these aggregates are used.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

",4.0,846.0,6.0,1.0702719688415527
116_utils.py,"1. **Vulnerable**
2. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Untrusted Environment Variables:** The code uses environment variables like OVERSEER_STORE and AUTHZ_FILE without proper validation or encryption. This can lead to vulnerabilities if these variables are exposed to untrusted sources.
   - **Unencrypted Configuration:** The load_privilege() function reads from the AUTHZ_FILE without encryption, making it susceptible to data breaches if the file is compromised.
   - **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate user inputs, which can lead to injection attacks if not properly secured.
   - **Potential SQL Injection:** The update_sp_state() function iterates over all SPs, which could be stored in a database. This could be a vector for SQL injection or XSS attacks if the data isn't properly sanitized.
   - **Lack of State Management Security:** The simple_PSP_policy() and promote_sp() functions manipulate SP states without proper security measures, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or state corruption.
   - **Insecure Datetime Handling:** The use of datetime and timedelta could potentially allow attackers to manipulate the system's clock, leading to unexpected behavior or attacks.

3. **Reason:** The code has multiple security vulnerabilities related to untrusted environment variables, unencrypted configuration files, lack of input sanitization, potential SQL injection, and insecure state management. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, disrupt service operations, or cause data breaches.","CVE: CVE-2022-31605
