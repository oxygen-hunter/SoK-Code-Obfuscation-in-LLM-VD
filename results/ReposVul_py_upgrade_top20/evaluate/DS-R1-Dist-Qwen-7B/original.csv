11_ElGamal.py,Inference failed,"CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']
CWE Description: 
",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
14_static.py,"1. **Vulnerability Identified**: The code has a potential vulnerability related to improper handling of the `root_dir` argument, which could be a vector for directory traversal or command injection attacks.

2. **Explanation**: The `static_view` class does not sanitize the `root_dir` argument. If `root_dir` is provided by an untrusted source, it could be used to execute arbitrary code or traverse directories, leading to potential attacks like directory enumeration or command injection.

3. **Suggested Fix**: Sanitize the `root_dir` argument by ensuring it is a valid, package-relative path or an asset specification. Use a secure method to resolve the `root_dir`, such as `resolve_asset_spec`, and validate the resulting path before processing.

4. **Reasoning**: The lack of sanitization around the `root_dir` argument makes it a potential entry point for attackers. By sanitizing and validating the `root_dir`, the code can prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of security breaches.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

",2.0,1063.0,6.0,1.1514875888824463
55_pathutils.py,"1. The code is vulnerable.  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
   - Directory traversal: The sanitize_path function may not prevent all directory traversal attacks if the path contains . or .. after normalization.  
   - Path sanitization: The is_safe_filesystem_path_component function may incorrectly mark some safe paths as unsafe.  
   - Platform issues: The use of os.path.splitdrive may not work correctly on Windows.  
   - Base_folder safety: If base_folder is not secure, it could be a vector for attacks.  
3. Reason: The code lacks robust path validation and doesn't handle edge cases or platform-specific functions, increasing the risk of security breaches.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

111_general.py,"1. **Vulnerable?** NO  
2. **Reason:** The code does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities. All aggregate functions use PostgreSQL's built-in capabilities, and the convert_value methods handle None values appropriately by returning empty collections or strings. There are no obvious SQL injection, type mismatch, or other security issues.  
3. **Conclusion:** The code is secure as it properly handles edge cases and uses standard PostgreSQL functions.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

116_utils.py,"1. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - **Potential Untrusted File Edits:** The `load_privilege()` function reads from an environment variable file, which could be vulnerable if the file is editable by untrusted parties.
   - **Insecure Date Handling:** The `fromisoformat()` method is risky if inputs are not sanitized, potentially leading to timing attacks.
   - **Sensitive Information in Logs:** Printing sensitive SP details in logs can expose information if logs are misconfigured.
   - **Environment Variable Risks:** Using `os.environ.get()` without proper validation can lead to unintended code execution if environment variables are misconfigured.
   - **Lack of Error Handling:** Critical operations lack proper exception handling, which could lead to unhandled errors.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - **File Permissions:** Enforce strict file permissions to prevent unauthorized edits to the privilege file.
   - **Sanitize Inputs:** Validate and sanitize inputs to `fromisoformat()` to mitigate timing attacks.
   - **Secure Logging:** Replace print statements with a secure logger to protect sensitive information.
   - **Environment Validation:** Properly validate and secure environment variables to prevent misconfiguration.
   - **Exception Handling:** Add try-except blocks around critical operations to handle exceptions gracefully.

3. **Conclusion:**
   The code has several security risks, including potential unauthorized file edits, insecure date handling,","CVE: CVE-2022-31605
