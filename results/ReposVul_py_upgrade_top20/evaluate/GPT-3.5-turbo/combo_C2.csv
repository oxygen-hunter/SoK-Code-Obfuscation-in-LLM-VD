14_static.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `get_resource_name` method at line 67. The method constructs the `resource_path` using user-controlled input (`path`) without proper validation, which can lead to path traversal attacks.
   - Unvalidated Redirect vulnerability in the `add_slash_redirect` method at line 158. The method constructs a redirect URL using user-controlled input (`request.path_url` and `request.query_string`) without proper validation, which can be abused for phishing attacks.
   - Lack of Input Validation in the `find_best_match` method at line 123. The method does not validate the input `files` properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
   - Lack of Input Validation in the `find_resource_path` method at line 85. The method does not validate the input `name` properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities such as IDOR, Unvalidated Redirect, and lack of input validation in certain methods.

4. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

55_pathutils.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - In the `sanitize_path` function, the code does not properly handle user-controlled input, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the function does not adequately prevent access to other data outside the intended directory. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the path and access sensitive files on the system.
     Vulnerable line: 
     ```python
     new_path = posixpath.join(new_path, part)
     ```
     Reason: The code does not check for directory traversal characters like "".."" which can be abused by an attacker.

   - In the `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function, the code does not sufficiently validate the path components for safe filesystem operations. It allows for potential path manipulation attacks by not properly checking for special characters or patterns that could lead to directory traversal.
     Vulnerable line:
     ```python
     return True
     ```
     Reason: The function does not thoroughly validate the path components, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

   - In the `path_to_filesystem` function, the code uses the `sanitize_path` function which has path traversal vulnerabilities. This can lead to an insecure conversion of the path to a local filesystem path relative to the base folder, potentially allowing an attacker to access unauthorized files on the system.
     Vulnerable line:
     ```python
     safe_path = os.path.join(safe_path, part)
     ```
     Reason: The code relies on the potentially vulnerable `sanitize_path` function for path manipulation, which can result in path traversal vulnerabilities.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent path traversal attacks.
   - Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the standard library to ensure safe filesystem operations.

4. Overall, the code contains vulnerabilities related to path traversal and insecure filesystem operations, which can be exploited by attackers to access unauthorized files on the system.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
