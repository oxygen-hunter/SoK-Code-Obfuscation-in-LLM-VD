CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

",4.0,1658.0,7.0,2.8540589809417725
14_static.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `resolve_resource_name` method at line 59. The method constructs the `resource_path` using user-controlled input (`secured_path`) without proper validation, which can lead to path traversal attacks.
   - Unvalidated Redirect vulnerability in the `redirect_with_slash` method at line 123. The method constructs a redirect URL using user-controlled input (`request.path_url` and `request.query_string`) without proper validation, which can be abused for phishing attacks.

3. Reason:
   The code is vulnerable to IDOR and Unvalidated Redirect vulnerabilities due to improper handling of user-controlled input.

4. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks in the `resolve_resource_name` method.
   - Validate and sanitize the redirect URL construction in the `redirect_with_slash` method to prevent Unvalidated Redirect vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability:
     - Vulnerable lines: 46, 50
     - Reason: The functions `getSanePath` and `getSafePath` in the `path_to_filesystem` function do not properly validate and sanitize the input path and base folder. This can lead to an IDOR vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the path to access unauthorized files or directories on the filesystem.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities. Ensure that the input paths are validated against a whitelist of allowed paths and do not allow access to sensitive system files or directories.

4. Note:
   - Further analysis may be required to identify additional vulnerabilities in the code.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
