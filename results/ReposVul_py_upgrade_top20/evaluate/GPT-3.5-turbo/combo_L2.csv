2. Vulnerability Type: Importing modules from Crypto.PublicKey.pubkey and Crypto.Util without specifying the exact modules can lead to potential security risks.
   Vulnerable Line: 
   - from Crypto.PublicKey.pubkey import *
   - from Crypto.Util import number
   Reason: Importing all modules using '*' can introduce unnecessary dependencies and potential conflicts with other modules. It is recommended to import only the specific modules needed.

3. The code is vulnerable due to the use of wildcard imports from the Crypto library, which can introduce unnecessary dependencies and potential conflicts with other modules. It is recommended to import only the specific modules needed to reduce the attack surface and improve code maintainability and readability.","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in the `get_resource_name` method at line 71. The method constructs the `resource_path` based on user input without proper validation, which can lead to path traversal attacks.
   - Unvalidated Redirect vulnerability in the `add_slash_redirect` method at line 143. The method constructs a redirect URL using user input without proper validation, which can be abused for phishing attacks.
   - Potential Path Traversal vulnerability in the `_secure_path` function at line 159. The function does not thoroughly validate the path elements, which could allow an attacker to traverse to sensitive directories.

3. Reason: The code contains vulnerabilities such as IDOR, Unvalidated Redirect, and potential Path Traversal due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

4. Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to mitigate these vulnerabilities.","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

55_pathutils.py,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Path Handling:
     - Vulnerable lines: 6, 14, 20
     - Reason: The code does not properly handle user-controlled input paths, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `sanitize_path` function does not adequately prevent directory traversal attacks, and the `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function does not sufficiently validate path components for safety. This can lead to an attacker manipulating paths to access unauthorized files or directories on the filesystem.

3. Recommendation:
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent path traversal attacks.
   - Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or libraries to ensure safe filesystem operations.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
