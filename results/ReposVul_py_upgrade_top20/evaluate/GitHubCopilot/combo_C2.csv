   - Weak key generation range — line 39 — x ∈ [2, p-1] allows x = p-1 ⇒ y = 1 (trivially weak public key); should exclude p-1 (use ≤ p-2).
   - Missing key/parameter validation — lines 48-55 — construct() accepts unvalidated (p,g,y[,x]), enabling small-subgroup/invalid-parameter attacks and DoS with malicious keys.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

14_static.py,"1. YES
2. - Path traversal (Windows drive-relative bypass): static_view.get_resource_name -> resource_path = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path))) and _secure_path (does not reject ':'); Reason: a segment like 'C:foo' contains no '/' or '\' and passes _secure_path, but on Windows os.path.join('C:\\docroot','C:foo') yields 'C:foo' (outside docroot), enabling access outside the intended directory.
   - Open redirect: add_slash_redirect -> url = request.path_url + '/' (and appending query_string); Reason: constructs an absolute redirect from user-controlled Host/path, which can be abused if Host header validation/proxy config is weak.
   - Information disclosure: raise HTTPNotFound(request.url) in __call__ and HTTPNotFound('Out of bounds: %s' % request.url) in get_resource_name; Reason: echoes full URL (including query params) in error body/logs, potentially leaking sensitive data.
   - Incomplete null-byte check: _invalid_element_chars = {'/', os.sep, '\\x00'}; Reason: '\\x00' is a literal backslash-x-zero-zero, not a null byte, so actual '\x00' isn’t filtered (could cause unexpected errors if it reaches file APIs).
   - Unbounded cache (DoS risk): get_possible_files -> self.filemap[resource_name] = result; Reason: attacker can request many unique resource names to grow the in-memory cache without eviction.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
