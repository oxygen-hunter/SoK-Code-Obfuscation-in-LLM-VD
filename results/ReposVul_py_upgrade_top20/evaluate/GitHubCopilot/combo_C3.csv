2. Vulnerabilities: (a) Incorrect ElGamal signature algorithm — in sign(...) VM program and verify(...): no k^{-1} multiplication and no hashing of M, enabling forgery and violating scheme definition; (b) User-controlled nonce K in encrypt(...) and sign(...): caller supplies K with no randomness/reuse protection, allowing nonce reuse/predictability and private key recovery; (c) Missing parameter validation — in construct(...) and generate(...): accepts external (p,g,y[,x]) without checks and picks g without ensuring subgroup order q (e.g., g=p-1 of order 2), enabling small-subgroup/invalid-parameter attacks; (d) Incomplete signature checks — in verify(...): checks range of a only, not 1 ≤ b ≤ p−2, enabling invalid signatures; (e) Side-channel risk — pow and arithmetic not constant-time over secrets (x, K), enabling timing leakage; (f) VM opcode gaps/DoS — VM.execute lacks CALL/MUL/MOD used by encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify/generate, causing runtime failures or denial of service; (g) Wildcard import — from Crypto.PublicKey.pubkey import * increases namespace collision risk

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Open redirect: add_slash_redirect builds an absolute URL from request.path_url and echoes the Host header, enabling host-header–based redirects/cache poisoning (function add_slash_redirect).
   - DoS/info disclosure: VM.execute lacks a 'CALL' handler, so CALL steps in static_view.__init__/__call__ corrupt the stack and trigger TypeError/NameError during path resolution (VM.execute, static_view.__init__/__call__, find_resource_path uses undefined resource_* symbols).
   - NUL-byte filtering bug: _invalid_element_chars uses the literal ""\\x00"" instead of the NUL character, failing to block actual NULs in path elements (declaration of _invalid_element_chars).
   - Cache poisoning risk: Vary: Accept-Encoding is only added when multiple files exist; serving a single compressed variant without unconditional Vary can poison shared caches (static_view.__call__ around FileResponse and _add_vary).
   - Potential arbitrary file read: if manifest_spec is attacker-controlled, ManifestCacheBuster resolves and reads arbitrary filesystem paths without validation (ManifestCacheBuster.__init__/get_manifest).

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. Vulnerabilities: Path traversal via broken sanitization and unsafe concatenation — uses posixpath.normpath on Windows and splits only on ""/"", allowing ""\""-based traversal and preserving leading "".."" (lines with posixpath.normpath(path), path.split(""/""), and string ADDs to build paths); Component check is bypassed by validating the literal ""split_path"" instead of the actual segment (code.append((""LOAD"", compile_is_safe_filesystem_path_component(""split_path"")))), so unsafe parts (.., absolute, drives) pass; No enforcement that the final path stays under base_folder (no os.path.commonpath check), enabling directory escape; VM logic invalidates checks — STORE overwrites the whole stack, LOAD never reads variables, and JZ compares popped values to 0 (string vs int), so conditionals don’t work (VM methods: POP/ADD/SUB/JZ/STORE); Potential DoS via unchecked stack underflows (POP/ADD/SUB) if instruction sequencing goes wrong.

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

2) Vulnerabilities:
- Arbitrary file read / potential unsafe YAML deserialization: load_privilege(): privilege_file = os.environ.get(""AUTHZ_FILE"", ""privilege.yml""); privilege = load_yaml(privilege_file) — ENV-controlled path can read sensitive files; if load_yaml uses unsafe loader, malicious YAML could execute code.
- Authorization bypass via fail-open: load_privilege(): bare except sets privilege = dict(), silently disabling authz on parsing/IO errors.
- Denial of Service: VM.execute(): multiple self.stack.pop() calls (POP/ADD/SUB) without underflow checks and JMP/JZ set self.pc = inst[1]-1 without bounds validation; crafted instructions can crash or loop indefinitely.
- Log/terminal injection: promote_sp(): f""Unable to promote {sp['sp_end_point']}, ..."": untrusted endpoint echoed to logs.
- Minor info disclosure: printing backend selection reveals deployment details.
