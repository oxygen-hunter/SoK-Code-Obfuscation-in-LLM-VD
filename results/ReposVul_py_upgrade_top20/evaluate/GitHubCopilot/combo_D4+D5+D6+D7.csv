2. - Textbook ElGamal encryption (no KDF/MAC/padding) → malleable and CCA-insecure: lines with def encrypt(...), def _encrypt(...), return pubkey.encrypt(...), a=pow(self.g,K,self.p); b=(M*pow(self.y,K,self.p))%self.p; reason: multiplicative malleability and no integrity.
   - Caller-supplied nonce K with no randomness/uniqueness enforcement: lines with def encrypt(self, plaintext, K), def sign(self, M, K), def _sign(self, M, K); reason: K reuse/predictability breaks confidentiality (encryption) and reveals private key (signature), only GCD check done.
   - Signing without hashing the message: lines with def sign(...), def _sign(...), def _verify(...); reason: using raw M breaks EUF-CMA security and enables forgeries; standard requires hashing M.
   - Broken signature verification uses undefined p: line in _verify: if sig[0] < 1 or sig[0] > p-1: (should be self.p); reason: raises NameError → DoS or potential bypass if caller swallows exceptions.
   - Broken construct(): uses tuple instead of tup repeatedly: lines in construct() checking len(tuple), iterating range(len(tuple)), accessing tuple[i]; reason: runtime errors/DoS, prevents safe key handling.
   - Flawed generator selection: lines in generate() where safe set to 0 if pow(obj.g, q, obj.p)==1 and odd divmod checks on (p-1, g) and its inverse; reason: may reject subgroup-order-q generators and accept unsuitable g, undermining subgroup-safety assumptions.
   - No key size enforcement: generate(bits, ...) accepts arbitrary small bits; reason: weak keys possible.
   - Side-channel risk: all big-int ops (pow, inverse) non-constant time in Python; reason: timing leakage of x/K.
   - Weak RNG surface: randfunc and K fully trusted from caller; reason: predictable RNG or adversarial K compromises keys/signatures.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. Vulnerabilities: Symlink traversal (get_resource_name: c = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, b))); find_resource_path: elif exists(name): return name) — no realpath/prefix check allows serving files outside docroot via symlinks; Missing Vary on content negotiation (__call__: if len(b) > 1: _add_vary(f, 'Accept-Encoding')) — when only one encoded variant exists, caches may serve compressed content to clients without Accept-Encoding, enabling cache poisoning; Potential open redirect (add_slash_redirect: a = request.path_url + '/' then appending '?' + request.query_string) — untrusted Host/query can produce a malicious Location header; NUL-byte check bug (_invalid_element_chars = {'/', os.sep, '\\x00'}) — uses literal “\\x00” instead of actual '\x00', failing to block NUL bytes and risking 500s or filter bypass.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. Vulnerabilities
- Absolute path/drive/UNC injection (directory traversal/base escape on Windows)
  - Vulnerable lines: in is_safe_filesystem_path_component:
    - ""components[0], _ = z"" followed by ""if components[0]: return components[0]""
  - Reason: Returning the drive string (truthy) treats presence of a drive/UNC as “safe”; then path_to_filesystem joins components with os.path.join, allowing inputs like ""C:\Windows"" or ""\\server\share"" to discard base and escape confinement.
- Symlink traversal (TOCTOU)
  - Vulnerable lines: in path_to_filesystem (entire function flow), no post-join confinement check.
  - Reason: The code never verifies that the final resolved path (e.g., os.path.realpath) remains under base, so a symlink inside base can redirect outside.
- Log injection
  - Vulnerable lines: log.LOGGER.debug(""Can't translate path safely to filesystem: %s"", d[1])
  - Reason: Logs untrusted input p; attackers can inject control characters to manipulate logs.

","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.

2. - Improper exception handling / fail-open (lines 11–16): bare except returns empty dict for AUTHZ_FILE, likely bypassing authorization on parse/read errors.
   - Potential insecure YAML deserialization (line 13): load_yaml on env-controlled file path (line 9) may use unsafe loader; a crafted YAML could trigger code execution and attacker-controlled path could be loaded.
   - Missing authorization for state-changing operations (lines 28–71): _3 and _4 allow registration/promotion/demotion and session ID assignment without authn/authz, enabling DoS/privilege manipulation.
   - DoS via unhandled exceptions (lines 21, 60): fromisoformat on untrusted last_heartbeat and _l[_m] lookup for arbitrary keys in _j can raise exceptions and crash the process.
   - Information disclosure via logs (lines 48, 65–66): prints internal sp_end_point and role changes, aiding reconnaissance/log injection if fields are attacker-controlled.
   - Trust boundary: behavior controlled by environment (lines 74–83). OVERSEER_STORE can switch to SQL/other backends; if attackers influence env/process launch, they may pivot to weaker stores.
