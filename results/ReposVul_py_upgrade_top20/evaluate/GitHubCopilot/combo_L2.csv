2. Vulnerabilities: user-supplied nonce K in sign/encrypt (""def sign(self,M,K)"", ""def _sign"", ""def encrypt"", ""def _encrypt"") → nonce reuse/predictable K leaks the private key and breaks IND-CPA; missing message hashing in signatures (""t=(M-self.x*a) % p1"", ""v2=pow(self.g,M,self.p)"") → messages are forgeable; undefined variable in _verify (""if sig[0]<1 or sig[0]>p-1"") → NameError/DoS and incomplete range checks; unvalidated key parameters in construct (accepts arbitrary p,g,y and uses 'tuple' instead of parameter) → weak/invalid keys and DoS; raw ElGamal without padding/encoding → malleable and CCA-unsafe; variable-time pow/inverse with secret x in _decrypt/_sign → timing side-channel; incorrect generator selection tests (rejecting g^q==1 and odd divmod checks) → may accept weak generators.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. - Path traversal/docroot escape on Windows: in get_resource_name() filesystem branch, resource_path = normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path))) without enforcing the final path stays under self.norm_docroot and _contains_invalid_element_char doesn’t block ':', allowing segments like ""C:foo"" to escape docroot (vulnerable lines: the join/normpath in get_resource_name and _invalid_element_chars definition).
   - Open redirect via untrusted Host header: add_slash_redirect builds an absolute Location from request.path_url + '/' + '?' + request.query_string (vulnerable lines: add_slash_redirect URL construction and HTTPMovedPermanently(url)); an attacker can manipulate Host to force redirects to an attacker-controlled domain.
   - Potential HTTP response splitting: raw request.query_string is concatenated into the Location header without CRLF stripping (vulnerable line: add_slash_redirect when appending qs), risking header injection if not sanitized by the framework.
   - Ineffective null-byte check: _invalid_element_chars = {'/', os.sep, '\\x00'} uses the literal backslash-x sequence instead of the null byte, failing to exclude '\x00' (vulnerable line: _invalid_element_chars definition).
   - Symlink escape: no verification that the resolved file path remains within docroot allows serving files outside via symlinks inside docroot (vulnerable lines: filesystem path resolution in get_resource_name without a startswith/self.norm_docroot check).
3. N/A
4. For response-splitting exploitability, behavior depends on how pyramid sanitizes/validates headers; if it normalizes or rejects CRLF, impact may be mitigated.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. - Symlink traversal/race (lines 29-39): The code joins untrusted components under base_folder without resolving and verifying the final realpath remains within base_folder, allowing escape via symlinks/junctions in base_folder.
   - NTFS Alternate Data Streams abuse (lines 16-27, 34-39): is_safe_filesystem_path_component does not reject "":"" so inputs like ""file.txt:ads"" are allowed on Windows, enabling ADS-based read/write bypasses.
   - Path normalization inconsistency (lines 5-14, 29-31): sanitize_path uses posixpath while validation/joining uses os.path, which can lead to OS-dependent mismatches and potential bypasses on Windows-style inputs.

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
