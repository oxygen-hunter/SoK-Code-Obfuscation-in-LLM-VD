2. - Undefined variable in verification (DoS/logic bug): line 55 (“p” used instead of self.p); raises NameError or skips proper bounds check on r, breaking verification reliability. 
   - Misuse-prone API: caller-supplied ephemeral K for encryption/signing (lines 34, 36, 38–40, 46–53); non-random/reused K breaks confidentiality (ElGamal) and leaks the private key in signatures; K=0 in encryption reveals plaintext (a=1, b=M). 
   - No parameter validation on construct/publickey (lines 25–30, 63): accepts arbitrary p,g,y,x without checking primality/order/range; enables invalid-parameter/small-subgroup attacks and potential key leakage during decrypt/sign. 
   - No hashing inside sign (lines 46–53): signs raw M, enabling misuse and weaker security; standard requires hashing M before signing. 
   - Ciphertext malleability / not CCA2-secure (lines 38–45): bare ElGamal without KDF/MAC/AEAD; lacks integrity and is malleable. 
   - Unbounded inputs allow CPU DoS: verify does not bound sig[1] (lines 54–57) and decrypt does not validate ciphertext ranges (lines 41–45), enabling very large exponents/values to trigger expensive pow. 
   - Potential timing side channels: arithmetic (pow, inverse, GCD) is variable-time across decrypt/sign/verify.

","CVE: CVE-2012-2417
CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.

2. Vulnerabilities: (a) Path Traversal (Windows drive-letter injection) — vulnerable code: resource_path=normcase(normpath(join(self.norm_docroot, path))) in get_resource_name (non-package branch) with no post-join prefix check; reason: ':' isn’t disallowed, so elements like ""C:foo"" can override the drive and escape docroot. (b) Null-byte handling/DoS — vulnerable code: _invalid_element_chars={'/', os.sep, '\\x00'} used by _contains_invalid_element_char; reason: uses literal ""\\x00"" instead of the null byte '\x00', so %00 bypasses the check and can trigger ValueError -> 500 when passed to os/path/file APIs.

","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

2. - Symlink traversal / path escape:
     - Vulnerable lines: in path_to_filesystem: ""safe_path=os.path.join(safe_path,part)"" and ""return safe_path"" (no post-join boundary check).
     - Reason: The code never resolves and verifies the final path; a symlink inside base_folder (e.g., ""link"" -> ""/etc"") allows requests like ""link/passwd"" to escape base_folder when resolved.
   - Log injection (low severity):
     - Vulnerable line: log.LOGGER.debug(""Can't translate path safely to filesystem: %s"", path)
     - Reason: Untrusted input is written to logs; attackers can inject newlines or control characters to forge/obfuscate log entries.

CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
