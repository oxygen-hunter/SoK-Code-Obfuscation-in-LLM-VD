CVE Description: PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.
CWE: ['CWE-310']

14_static.py,"1. Vulnerable: NO

2. Not applicable.

3. Reason: The code carefully validates and sanitizes user‐supplied paths (for example, through the _secure_path function that checks for dot segments and forbidden characters), uses normalized file path joining (e.g. using normpath and normcase), and defers to Pyramid’s asset‐ and response–handling functions. These practices, along with relying on established library functions for file access and response construction, indicate that no immediate security vulnerabilities (such as path traversal, injection, or other unsafe file operations) are present in the code.

4. (Not applicable.)","CVE: CVE-2023-40587
CVE Description: Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

55_pathutils.py,"1. Vulnerable: NO

2. Reason:  
   • The code first normalizes the input path using posixpath.normpath, which removes redundant and dangerous components like “..” and “.”.  
   • It then rebuilds the path from only the safe components (ignoring “.” and “..”) using a controlled recursive join.  
   • When converting the sanitized path to a local filesystem path, it verifies that each component is safe (i.e., it is a single path component with no drive or embedded directories) before joining it with the base_folder.  
   • This process prevents directory traversal and ensures that any user-supplied path cannot escape the designated base directory.  

Thus, based on the provided functions and their checks, there are no detected vulnerabilities in this code.","CVE: CVE-2016-1505
CVE Description: The filesystem storage backend in Radicale before 1.1 on Windows allows remote attackers to read or write to arbitrary files via a crafted path, as demonstrated by /c:/file/ignore.

111_general.py,"1. Vulnerable: NO

2. Reason:  
   • The code defines custom aggregate classes that extend Django’s ORM functionality and relies on Django’s built‐in mechanisms for safely constructing SQL queries.  
   • No external or unsanitized user input is directly interpolated into SQL statements, and templating is handled via Django’s standards, thereby avoiding SQL injection risks.  
   • The conversions and type handling for aggregated data (e.g., converting falsy values to [] or '') follow expected patterns without introducing security issues.  
   • Overall, the code makes use of Django’s secure ORM practices, and no identifiable security vulnerabilities are present.","CVE: CVE-2020-7471
CVE Description: Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.
