2. - Vulnerability type: Missing access control | airPort.sol:3 | `transfer` is `public` with no caller validation, so anyone can trigger `transferFrom` calls on token `_b` and drain `_a`’s allowance through this contract.
   - Vulnerability type: Unchecked low-level call result | airPort.sol:7 | `_b.call(...)` ignores the returned `success` flag, so failed token transfers (or calls to non-conforming contracts) go unnoticed while the function still reports success.

2. - Type: Insecure ownership initialization  
     Location: `TokenBank.sol:35-37`  
     Reason: `initTokenBank()` is publicly callable and overwrites `owner` with `msg.sender`, allowing any account to seize ownership and run all `onlyOwner` withdrawals.  
   - Type: Reentrancy  
     Location: `TokenBank.sol:51-55`  
     Reason: `WithdrawToHolder` issues `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` before decreasing the holder balance, so a malicious owner contract (made possible by the bug above) can reenter and drain the bank before the balance is reduced.

2. Vulnerabilities:  
- `demo.sol:3` — Missing access control: `transfer` is `public`, so any caller can trigger token movements using allowances that this contract holds from arbitrary `x`, letting attackers drain approved funds.  
- `demo.sol:7` — Unchecked low-level call: the `y.call(...)` result is ignored, so failed or malicious external calls go unnoticed while the function still returns `true`, hiding transfer failures or unexpected behavior.

- Vulnerability: `Timestamp dependence` at `TimedCrowdsale.sol:4` (the comparison relies on `block.timestamp`, which miners can skew slightly to alter time-based logic, potentially marking the sale finished earlier or later than intended)
