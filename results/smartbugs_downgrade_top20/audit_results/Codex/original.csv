2. Unrestricted delegatecall (lines 7-9): `forward` is `public` with no access control, so any caller can `delegatecall` arbitrary logic into the proxy’s storage context. An attacker can point `callee` to a malicious contract that overwrites `owner`, drains funds, or self-destructs the proxy.

- `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);` in `airPort.sol:7` uses a low-level `call` without checking the returned success flag. If `transferFrom` reverts or returns false, the failure is silently ignored and the function still returns true, letting attackers (or callers) assume tokens moved when they did not.

2. - Reentrancy + integer underflow at `TokenBank.sol:44-48`. `_addr.call.value(_wei)` forwards all gas before `Holders[_addr]` is updated. If the owner is a contract, its fallback can re-enter `WithdrawToHolder` repeatedly; the balance check still sees the pre-update value while each stacked call later subtracts `_wei`. Eventually a subtraction executes when the stored value is already below `_wei`, underflowing to ~2²⁵⁶ and letting the attacker drain the bank.  
   - Unchecked Ether transfer at `TokenBank.sol:47-48`. The return value of `_addr.call.value(_wei)` is ignored, so a reverting recipient leaves the contract’s Ether untouched but still reduces `Holders[_addr]`, permanently desynchronizing accounting and locking user funds.  
   - Unchecked token transfer at `TokenBank.sol:38-41` and `Token.sol:19-20`. `WithdrawToken` uses a low-level call to `transfer` and ignores the boolean result; a token that returns `false` or reverts leaves the contract still holding the tokens while `Holders[_to]` is zeroed, so the holder can’t recover their assets.  
   - Silent fund loss on deposits at `TokenBank.sol:34-36`. Deposits of `MinDeposit` or less are accepted (the Ether stays in the contract) but not recorded in `Holders`, preventing the sender from ever withdrawing those funds.

2. - Type: Unchecked low-level call result; Lines: demo.sol:7; Reason: `caddress.call(...)` ignores its boolean return value, so failed `transferFrom` calls (e.g., due to insufficient allowance or token reverts) leave the loop continuing and the function returning `true`, enabling silent transfer failures or misleading callers into believing transfers succeeded.

127_time_manipulation.sol,"The code is vulnerable.  
- Vulnerability: `block.timestamp` manipulation (line `return block.timestamp >= 1546300800;`)  
- Reason: In Solidity 0.4.25, miners can skew `block.timestamp` within a tolerance window, so relying on it to decide when the sale finishes enables malicious blocks to close or extend the sale slightly.
