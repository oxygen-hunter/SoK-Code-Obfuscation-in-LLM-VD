2. - `Unrestricted delegatecall / Access control bypass`: `forward` in `Proxy` (`forward` declaration through delegatecall block, roughly lines 7‑11). The guard `alwaysTrue || owner == address(0x0)` is permanently true because `alwaysTrue` is hardcoded to `true`, so any caller can trigger `callee.delegatecall(_data)`. That lets arbitrary external contracts run in the proxy’s context, modify its storage/balance, or execute privileged logic.

- Vulnerability: `Unchecked low-level call return value` (`airPort.sol:14` and `airPort.sol:16`). Using `caddress.call(...)` ignores the boolean success flag, so any failed or reverted external call will be silently skipped while the function still returns `true`. Callers believe a token transfer succeeded even though nothing moved, enabling loss of accounting integrity or downstream logic errors.

2. - `TokenBank.sol:40` – Improper access control: `initTokenBank()` is public and unguarded, so any caller can reset `owner` to themselves (the `randomValue` branch is always true) and then drain administrative functions.
   - `TokenBank.sol:66-67` – Reentrancy + integer underflow: `_addr.call.value(_wei)` forwards all gas before `Holders[_addr]` is reduced, letting a malicious contract re-enter `WithdrawToHolder()` while balances are unchanged; the subsequent unchecked subtraction allows repeated withdrawals and wraps the holder balance.
   - `Token.sol:32` / `TokenBank.sol:66` – Unchecked low-level calls: both external `call` invocations ignore the boolean result, so failed token transfers or Ether sends appear successful, breaking accounting and enabling silent loss of funds.

2. - `Unchecked low-level call` (`demo.sol:12`): uses `caddress.call(...)` without verifying the returned success flag, yet the function still returns `true`. A malicious or failing token contract can force the call to fail while making this function report success, breaking downstream accounting or permission logic and enabling loss of funds for systems that rely on this wrapper.

2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Type: Timestamp dependence (`SWC-116`); Location: `TimedCrowdsale.sol:3-9`; Reason: Sale completion relies on `block.timestamp`, which miners can skew by ~15 minutes, letting them finish or prolong the sale window slightly in their favor.
