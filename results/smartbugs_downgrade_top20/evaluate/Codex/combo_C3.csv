2. - Unrestricted `delegatecall` (Proxy.sol:34-44, Proxy.sol:25): `forward` is `public` with no owner check, yet it lets any caller craft a “program” that leads to `delegatecall` on user‑chosen `callee` and calldata. Because `delegatecall` runs in this contract’s storage context, an attacker can execute arbitrary logic and overwrite critical state, effectively taking full control of the proxy.

31_unchecked_low_level_calls.sol,"YES  
- `airPort.sol:24` — Unchecked low-level call return value (SWC-104). The contract uses `caddress.call(...)` but never inspects the boolean it returns, so any failure in `transferFrom` is silently ignored. Callers will believe tokens were moved even when the external call reverted or returned `false`, breaking expected safety guarantees.  
- `airPort.sol:15` and `airPort.sol:40` — Denial of service through incorrect program-counter advancement. `vm.pc` is incremented inside the `PUSH` handler and again after the dispatch loop, so each immediate instruction skips the following slot. This quickly desynchronises the opcode/data streams, causing the VM to read uninitialised values and reach `CALL` without the required stack depth. The resulting out-of-bounds stack access reverts the whole transaction, making `transfer` permanently unusable.

2. - `Missing access control` – `TokenBank.sol:97` lets anyone call `initTokenBank()` and reset `owner` to themselves, so every `onlyOwner` gate can be bypassed.  
   - `Reentrancy` – `TokenBank.sol:115-120` sends ether with `_addr.call.value(_wei)()` before shrinking `Holders[_addr]`, allowing a malicious owner-controlled contract to re-enter `WithdrawToHolder` and drain funds once it has taken ownership via `initTokenBank()`.

48_unchecked_low_level_calls.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Unchecked low-level call return value (`demo.sol:56`): `caddress.call(...)` is invoked without verifying the boolean it returns, so a failing or malicious token contract can make this function report success while no transfer occurred, breaking downstream accounting and enabling loss of funds that rely on the boolean result.  
   - Reentrancy exposure via untrusted external call (`demo.sol:13-18`, `demo.sol:56`): user-controlled `_caddress` is called with arbitrary code after shared state (`stack`, `programCounter`, `_tos`, `v`) is updated and before it is restored, so a reentrant call back into `transfer` can corrupt the outer invocation’s stack bookkeeping, forcing reverts or hijacking the execution flow—effectively a denial of service or logic-tampering vector.

127_time_manipulation.sol,"1. YES  
2. - `State-mutability violation / DoS` – `TimedCrowdsale.sol:31-34`. `isSaleFinished()` is marked `view` yet writes to storage (`pc = 0`, `stack.length = 0` and the later `stack.push(...)` inside `execute()`). External calls to a `view` function are performed via `STATICCALL`, so any attempted `SSTORE` reverts. As a result, every external call to `isSaleFinished()` reverts, blocking callers from checking sale status.  
   - `Timestamp manipulation` – `TimedCrowdsale.sol:17-24`. The sale-completion logic relies directly on `block.timestamp`, letting miners skew the value within the allowable drift (roughly ±15 seconds). That can move the effective closing time, enabling slight extensions or early termination of the sale beyond what the contract owner intends.
