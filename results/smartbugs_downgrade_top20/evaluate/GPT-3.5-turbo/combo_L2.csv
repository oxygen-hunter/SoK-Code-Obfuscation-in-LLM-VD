2. Vulnerability Type: Delegatecall to untrusted callee
   Vulnerable Line: 13
   Reason: The `forward` function uses `delegatecall` to execute code from an external contract specified by the `callee` address. This can be dangerous as it allows the external contract to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Proxy contract, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerability Type: External Call to Untrusted Contracts
   Vulnerable Line: 10
   Reason: The `caddress.call(id, from, _tos[i], v);` statement allows for external calls to untrusted contracts, which can lead to various security vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and unexpected behavior.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Delegatecall: Vulnerable line is `token.call(bytes4(sha3(""transfer(address,uint256)"")),to,amount);` in the `WithdrawToken` function of the `Token` contract. The `call` function is used with user-supplied data which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
   - Unrestricted Ether Withdrawal: Vulnerable line is `_addr.call.value(_wei);` in the `WithdrawToHolder` function of the `TokenBank` contract. This line allows anyone to call the function and withdraw Ether from the contract without proper authorization.

2. Vulnerability Type: Untrusted Call
   Vulnerable Line: caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);
   Reason: The code uses the `call` function to make an external contract call without checking the return value. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or unexpected behavior if the called contract is malicious.

3. The code is vulnerable to untrusted call vulnerabilities due to the use of the `call` function without proper checks.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,656.0,6.0,0.8165569305419922

2. Vulnerability Type: Timestamp Dependence
   Vulnerable Line: 4
   Reason: The code uses the `block.timestamp` to determine if the sale is finished. This can be manipulated by miners to front-run transactions or manipulate the outcome of the contract. It is recommended to use a more secure way to determine the end of the sale, such as block number or an external oracle.
