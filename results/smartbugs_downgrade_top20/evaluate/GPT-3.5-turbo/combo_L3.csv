2. Vulnerability Type: Delegatecall to untrusted callee
   Vulnerable Line: 7
   Reason: The `forward` function uses `delegatecall` to execute code from the `callee` address. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities if the `callee` address is controlled by an attacker.

2. Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary Contract Execution
   Vulnerable Line: caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);
   Reason: The code uses the `call` function to execute a function on a contract based on the provided address `caddress`. This can lead to arbitrary contract execution vulnerabilities if the `caddress` is controlled by an attacker.

3. The code is vulnerable to arbitrary contract execution due to the use of the `call` function with an external address. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary functions on arbitrary contracts, leading to potential security risks.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,680.0,6.0,1.2321221828460691

2. Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy
   Vulnerable Lines: 34
   Reason: The `WithdrawToHolder` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attack as it allows the recipient to call back into the contract before the state is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

3. YES
4. The code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack in the `WithdrawToHolder` function due to the incorrect order of operations.",unchecked low level calls,2.0,653.0,6.0,1.1943650245666504

2. Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary Contract Execution
   Vulnerable Line: caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);
   Reason: The code allows arbitrary contract execution by calling the `call` function on the `caddress` with the provided function signature and parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. The code is vulnerable to arbitrary contract execution due to the use of the `call` function with dynamic function signature and parameters.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,655.0,6.0,0.7980587482452393

2. Vulnerability Type: Timestamp Dependence
   Vulnerable Line: return block.timestamp>=1546300800;
   Reason: The code uses the block.timestamp to determine if the sale is finished. This can be manipulated by miners to front-run transactions or manipulate the outcome of the function.
