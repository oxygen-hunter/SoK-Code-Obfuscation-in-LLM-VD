17_access_control.sol,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Lack of input validation: The `forward` function does not validate the input parameters `callee` and `_data`, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or unexpected behavior.
   - Delegatecall to untrusted contracts: The use of `delegatecall` with an arbitrary `callee` address can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerable lines:
   - Line 14: `require(callee.delegatecall(_data));`

4. Reason: The code is vulnerable due to lack of input validation and the use of `delegatecall` with an arbitrary address, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",access control,2.0,699.0,6.0,0.8616220951080322

2. Vulnerability Type: Unrestricted Ether Transfer
   Vulnerable Line: 11
   Reason: The `caddress.call` function allows arbitrary code execution and can be used to transfer Ether to any address without proper checks and restrictions. This can lead to unauthorized Ether transfers and potential security risks.

3. The code is vulnerable to an unrestricted Ether transfer vulnerability due to the use of the `caddress.call` function without proper checks and restrictions.",unchecked low level calls,3.0,649.0,6.0,0.8230345249176025

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Insecure Delegatecall: Vulnerable line is in the `WithdrawToken` function at line 33. The use of `token.call` with `sha3` function can lead to potential security vulnerabilities as it allows arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially call malicious functions on the `token` contract.
   - Unprotected Ether Transfer: Vulnerable line is in the `WithdrawToHolder` function at line 63. The direct use of `_addr.call.value(_wei)` for transferring Ether is risky as it does not include any checks or validations. This can lead to reentrancy attacks and loss of funds.

2. Vulnerability Type: Unrestricted Ether Transfer
   Vulnerable Line: caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);
   Reason: The code allows arbitrary contracts to be called using the `call` function without any restrictions. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or unauthorized ether transfers.

127_time_manipulation.sol,"1. Whether the code is vulnerable or not: YES
2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Time Manipulation
   - Vulnerable lines: 6
   - Reason: The code uses a fixed timestamp value (1546300800) to determine if the sale is finished. This is a security vulnerability as an attacker can manipulate the system time to bypass the sale finish condition. It is recommended to use block.timestamp for time-based conditions in smart contracts to prevent time manipulation attacks.",time manipulation,3.0,649.0,6.0,0.9048290252685548
