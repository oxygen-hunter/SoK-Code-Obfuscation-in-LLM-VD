   - YES

2. If YES, please list the vulnerabilities type, the vulnerable lines, and the reason.
   - **Vulnerability Type**: Delegatecall Injection
     - **Vulnerable Line**: `require(callee.delegatecall(_data));`
     - **Reason**: The use of `delegatecall` allows the `callee` contract to execute code in the context of the `Proxy` contract. This means that the `callee` can modify the state of the `Proxy` contract, including changing the `owner` address. If an attacker can control the `callee` address or the `_data` payload, they can execute arbitrary code and potentially take over the contract.

   - **Vulnerability Type**: Missing Access Control
     - **Vulnerable Line**: `function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public {`
     - **Reason**: The `forward` function is publicly accessible, meaning anyone can call it. Without proper access control, any user can invoke this function and potentially exploit the `delegatecall` vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

   - YES

2. If YES, please list the vulnerabilities type, the vulnerable lines, and the reason.
   - **Vulnerability Type:** Use of `call` for External Calls
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 9: `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);`
     - **Reason:** The use of `call` is not recommended for making external calls because it does not provide type safety and does not throw exceptions on failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails, as it will not revert the transaction. Instead, it returns a boolean indicating success or failure, which is not checked in this code. This can lead to potential security issues such as reentrancy attacks or failed transactions that are not properly handled.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Input Validation
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 6: `function transfer(address from,address caddress,address[] _tos,uint v)public returns (bool)`
     - **Reason:** The function does not perform any validation on the `from`, `caddress`, or `_tos` addresses. This can lead to issues if invalid or malicious addresses are provided. For example, if `caddress` is a contract that does not implement the expected `transferFrom` function, the call will fail silently.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Reentrancy
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 9: `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v);`
     - **Reason:** The use of `call` can potentially open up the contract to reentrancy attacks, especially if the called contract is untrusted and can make calls back into the `airPort` contract before the loop completes.

2. If YES, please list the vulnerabilities type, the vulnerable lines, and the reason.

   - **Reentrancy Vulnerability**:
     - Vulnerable Lines: `WithdrawToHolder` function
     - Reason: The function uses `call.value()` to send Ether, which is a low-level call that forwards all remaining gas. This can allow a reentrancy attack if the `_addr` is a contract that has a fallback function. The attacker can re-enter the contract before the state is updated, potentially draining funds.

   - **Unrestricted Access to `initTokenBank`**:
     - Vulnerable Lines: `initTokenBank` function
     - Reason: This function can be called by anyone to reset the owner to the caller, which can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract.

   - **Use of `call` for Token Transfer**:
     - Vulnerable Lines: `WithdrawToken` function
     - Reason: The use of `call` for token transfers is unsafe because it does not check for the success of the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the token contract does not implement the `transfer` function correctly or if it returns false.

   - **Lack of Access Control on `confirmOwner`**:
     - Vulnerable Lines: `confirmOwner` function
     - Reason: The function allows anyone who knows the `newOwner` address to confirm ownership without any additional checks, which can lead to unauthorized ownership changes.

   - **Shadowing of State Variables**:
     - Vulnerable Lines: `Token` contract's `owner` variable
     - Reason: The `owner` variable in the `Token` contract shadows the `owner` variable in the `Ownable` contract, which can lead to confusion and potential security issues.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Use of `call` for External Calls
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 7: `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);`
     - **Reason:** The use of `call` is dangerous because it does not check for the success of the external call. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails, as the transaction will continue executing. Additionally, `call` can be exploited for reentrancy attacks if the called contract is malicious or compromised.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Lack of Input Validation
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 5: `function transfer(address from,address caddress,address[] _tos,uint[] v)public returns (bool)`
     - **Reason:** The function does not validate the length of the `_tos` and `v` arrays to ensure they are the same. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors or unintended behavior if the arrays are of different lengths.

   - **Vulnerability Type:** Reentrancy
     - **Vulnerable Lines:** Line 7: `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i]);`
     - **Reason:** The use of `call` can be exploited for reentrancy attacks, especially if the called contract is untrusted. The function does not use any mechanisms to prevent reentrancy, such as the checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards.

2. If YES, please list the vulnerabilities type, the vulnerable lines, and the reason.
   - **Timestamp Dependence**: The vulnerability is in the `isSaleFinished` function, specifically in the line `return block.timestamp >= 1546300800;`.
     - **Reason**: The use of `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners to some extent. If the contract logic relies on the exact timing of events, such as determining whether a sale is finished, it can be exploited. Miners can adjust the timestamp within a certain range to influence the outcome of the function, potentially allowing them to end the sale earlier or later than intended.
