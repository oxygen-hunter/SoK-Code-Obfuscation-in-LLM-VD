2. - Unprotected initializer (line 5): `function missing()` was likely intended as the constructor, but because its name casing doesn’t match the contract (`Missing` vs `missing`), Solidity 0.4.24 treats it as a regular public function. Any caller can invoke it to set themselves as `owner`, then immediately call `withdraw()` to drain the contract’s balance.

2. - Missing.sol:9 — Unprotected ownership initialization (constructor misuse). The intended constructor is named `Constructor`, but in Solidity ≥0.4.22 only the `constructor` keyword is recognized; this function is therefore an ordinary public function that anyone can call after deployment to set `owner = msg.sender`, allowing attackers to seize control and drain funds via `withdraw()`.

20_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Insecure initialization / broken access control (`Wallet.sol:5-12`). The `initWallet()` function is `public` and can be called repeatedly, letting any caller set `creator` to their own address at any time (no guard to restrict it to the real deployer or to a single call).  
   - Consequence: An attacker who calls `initWallet()` becomes the `creator` and can then invoke `migrateTo()` to drain the entire contract balance to an arbitrary address (`Wallet.sol:24-30`).

2. - Permanent funds locking / denial of service – lines 8-27. `opaquePredicate` is initialized to `false` and never exposed for update, so the `withdrawTokens`/`withdrawEther` logic that actually releases assets is never reachable. Any ether or tokens sent to this contract become permanently stuck.  
   - Reentrancy surface via unchecked low-level call – line 32. `addr.call.value(0 wei)()` forwards all remaining gas to an arbitrary address without any guard or state change before the call. A malicious callee can re-enter `getTokens` (or other public functions) repeatedly, leading to denial-of-service through unbounded recursion today and leaving the contract open to reentrancy exploits if additional stateful logic is ever added.

2. - Type: Denial of Service (DoS) via external call failure; Vulnerable line: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));` at line 12; Reason: forwarding funds to the previous frontrunner with `send` lets that address (e.g., a contract with a reverting fallback) block the `require`, preventing any higher bids and locking the auction.
