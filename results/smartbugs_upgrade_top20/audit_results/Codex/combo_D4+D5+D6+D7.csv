- `Unprotected initialization` in `contract Missing` (`missing()` and `oMod`) – lines 6-12. The supposed owner variable `oStruct.o` is never safely initialized; any caller can execute `missing()` at any time and overwrite the stored owner address, then call `withdraw()` to drain all funds.

2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Type: Unprotected ownership takeover (missing constructor); Lines: `contract Missing`:5; Reason: In Solidity 0.4.24 the constructor must match the contract name, but `function C()` is just a public function. Any account can call `C()` at any time to set `o` to themselves, then call `w()` to drain `this.balance`.

20_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Wallet.sol:7 — `initWallet()` lacks any access control or one-time guard, so any caller (including attackers post-deployment) can invoke it and set `s.a` to themselves. This lets them seize ownership and then call `migrateTo()` to drain the contract, making it an insecure initialization/ownership takeover vulnerability.

62_unchecked_low_level_calls.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Missing access control — `EtherGet.sol:14-20` — `withdrawTokens`/`withdrawEther` lack an owner check, so any caller can trigger premature asset withdrawal to `data.addr`, breaking expected lockup or timing guarantees.  
   - Unchecked token transfer result — `EtherGet.sol:17` — the contract ignores the boolean return from `tc.transfer`, so a malicious/non‑standard token can signal failure without reverting, leaving funds stuck while the contract believes the withdrawal succeeded.  
   - Low-level external call surface — `EtherGet.sol:23-25` — `getTokens` makes arbitrary `addr.call` iterations with full gas and no guards, enabling reentrancy into other functions or deliberate gas exhaustion/DoS.

- Denial of Service – `DosAuction`, line 9 (`require(s.x.send(s.y));`): A malicious current leader can make `send` fail (e.g., fallback reverts), causing the `require` to revert every future `bid` and permanently locking the auction.
