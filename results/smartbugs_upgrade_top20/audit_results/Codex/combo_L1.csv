2. Access-control takeover (line 7-8): `function OX9F5D1B7C()` is a public, non-constructor function that sets `OX3A9BC2F1 = msg.sender`. Any account can call it after deployment to become the “owner”, then call `OX4C2E8F9A` (line 10) to transfer out the entire balance.

2. - Vulnerability: Unprotected owner initialization (missing constructor). Lines: 5-7 (`function OX2B7E3A5C() public { OX3F2A1B7C = msg.sender; }`). Reason: This function is publicly callable and sets the owner variable; anyone can invoke it after deployment to seize ownership, then call `OX4C7F9B8D()` to withdraw the entire balance.

20_access_control.sol,"YES  
- Vulnerability: Improper access control – `OX7B4DF339.sol:5` (`function OXF1A5B2B1() public`) – In Solidity 0.4.24 constructors must share the contract name (`OX7B4DF339`). Because this function uses a different name it stays a normal public function, so any caller can set `OX8F2A66C4` to themselves at any time. That lets an attacker satisfy the owner check in `OX7B4DF339.sol:14` and drain the entire contract balance via `OX6D7A4E9F`.

2. - Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary external call / missing access control  
     Vulnerable Lines: `OX2A6B9D47.sol:18-21` (function `OX4E7B9D5C`)  
     Reason: The public function executes a low-level `call` on any address supplied by the caller, forwarding all remaining gas and acting with this contract’s identity. An attacker can coerce the contract into calling privileged functions on other contracts that trust this contract as the caller, effectively abusing that trust relationship.

138_denial_of_service.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS) via `address.send`  
     - Line: `OX5F6G7H8I` function body (specifically `require(OX1A2B3C4D.send(OX9E8F7G6H));`)  
     - Reason: `send` forwards only 2300 gas. If `OX1A2B3C4D` is a contract whose fallback needs more gas or deliberately reverts, the `send` call returns false, the `require` triggers, and the whole function reverts. This permanently blocks new participants from calling `OX5F6G7H8I`, locking the contract.
