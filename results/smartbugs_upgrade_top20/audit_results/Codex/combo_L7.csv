2. - Access-control takeover — `Missing.sol:14` / `Missing.sol:15` — `missing()` is a normal public function (its name does not match the contract name, so it is not a constructor in Solidity 0.4.x). Any caller can invoke it at any time to overwrite `owner`, seize the only-owner role, and drain funds via `withdraw()`.

19_access_control.sol,"YES  
- `function Constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }` (`Missing.sol`:5) — Unprotected initialization. In Solidity 0.4.x a constructor must match the contract name (`Missing`), so this function is just a public method that anyone can call after deployment to set themselves as `owner`, giving arbitrary callers access to `withdraw()`.

20_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. `Unprotected initializer` at `Wallet.sol:initWallet` (line 5) and `Wallet.sol:migrateTo` (line 18): `initWallet` is a public function that anyone can call at any time to set themselves as `creator`, so an attacker can seize control and then invoke `migrateTo` to drain all funds.

62_unchecked_low_level_calls.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Access control: `EtherGet.sol:9` — `withdrawTokens` is `public` with no owner check, so any caller can force the contract to send its entire token balance to `owner`, preventing the contract from holding tokens for other users or workflows.  
   - Access control: `EtherGet.sol:10` — `withdrawEther` is also `public` with no restriction, letting anyone trigger an immediate transfer of the contract’s full Ether balance to `owner`, enabling griefing/front-running scenarios where Ether cannot remain in escrow.

138_denial_of_service.sol,"**Findings**  
- Code is vulnerable: YES  
- Vulnerability: `Denial of Service (DoS) via external refund` — `DosAuction.sol:9-12` uses `call(gas, currentFrontrunner, currentBid, ...)` to refund the previous frontrunner. A malicious frontrunner can force this call to revert (or consume all gas) in its fallback, triggering the `revert` and blocking all subsequent bids permanently.

**Next steps**  
1. Move to a pull-based withdrawal pattern so bidders reclaim their funds themselves.
