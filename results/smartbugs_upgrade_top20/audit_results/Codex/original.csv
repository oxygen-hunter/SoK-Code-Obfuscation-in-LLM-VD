12_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. - Vulnerability: Access-control bypass / ownership takeover – `Missing.sol:5` allows any caller to invoke `missing()` (not treated as a constructor because of the case mismatch) and overwrite `owner`, so an attacker can seize control and drain funds via `withdraw()`.

19_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. Vulnerabilities:  
- Incorrect constructor declaration — `Missing.sol:8` — In Solidity v0.4.24 constructors must use the `constructor` keyword. The function `Constructor()` is treated as a normal public method, so it is never executed automatically; `owner` stays the zero address, no account satisfies `onlyowner`, and every deposited fund becomes permanently locked (Denial of Service on withdrawals).

20_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. Access control flaw – `Wallet.sol:5`. `initWallet()` is `public` and can be called repeatedly, so any caller can overwrite `creator` and gain the ability to drain funds via `migrateTo()`.  
3. N/A (vulnerable).  
4. N/A (conclusion certain).

62_unchecked_low_level_calls.sol,"YES  
- `Access control`: `EtherGet.sol:9`, `EtherGet.sol:13` – Both `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` are declared `public` with no owner check, so any caller can drain all ERC‑20 tokens and Ether the contract holds.

138_denial_of_service.sol,"1. YES  
2. Type: Denial of Service via failing refund (`DosAuction.sol:7-8`). Reason: The contract uses `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)` inside the `require`; a malicious frontrunner can deploy a fallback consuming >2300 gas so the `send` fails, causing every later bid to revert and permanently blocking the auction.
