2. - Incorrect constructor / Unprotected initializer: line with “function C() public { o = msg.sender; }”. In Solidity 0.4.24 the constructor must be named “Missing” or use “constructor()”; as written, C() is a public function anyone can call anytime to set/reset owner, enabling takeover.
   - Privilege escalation → Unrestricted withdrawal: line with “function w() public m { o.transfer(this.balance); }”. After an attacker sets o via C(), they can call w() to drain the entire balance.
   - DoS risk via address.transfer gas stipend: line with “function w() public m { o.transfer(this.balance); }”. transfer forwards 2300 gas and will revert if o is a contract with a reverting fallback or due to gas cost changes, potentially locking funds.

2. - Broken access control / owner takeover: lines 5,16 — initWallet() lets anyone set s.a at any time, and migrateTo() authorizes solely by s.a, so an attacker can set themselves owner and drain funds.
   - Unauthorized full-balance drain and state desynchronization: lines 15–17 — migrateTo() transfers this.balance to arbitrary address without reconciling balances[], leaving users with non-withdrawable recorded balances after funds are moved.
   - Withdrawal DoS and CEI violation: lines 12–13 — msg.sender.transfer() (2300 gas) can revert for contract recipients or with gas cost changes, and state is updated after the external call (violating checks-effects-interactions), causing fragile behavior.

2. Vulnerabilities: a) Unchecked low-level call (line 22): addr.call.value(0)() return value ignored, enabling reentrancy/arbitrary code execution and DoS; b) Unbounded user-controlled loop (lines 20-23): num can be very large causing gas exhaustion/DoS; c) Unchecked ERC-20 transfer result (line 15): tc.transfer(...) return not checked, so token transfer may silently fail; d) DoS via transfer gas stipend (line 18): data.addr.transfer(this.balance) uses 2300 gas which can revert/lock ETH if owner is a contract or due to gas cost changes; e) Arbitrary external call with all gas (line 22): forwards all gas to addr allowing reentrancy into this contract without guards.

DoS (Denial of Service) via refund push/using send: lines 7–9 (especially line 8: require(s.x.send(s.y))); a malicious current highest bidder (contract) can make send fail (revert or >2300 gas), causing require to revert and blocking all future bids; use a withdrawal pattern instead of pushing refunds.
