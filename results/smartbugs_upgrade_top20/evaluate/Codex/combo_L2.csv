12_access_control.sol,"**Findings**
- `Missing.sol:5` — Insecure access control (constructor bypass): the `missing()` function should be the constructor, but its name does not match the contract (`Missing` vs `missing`). As a result, any caller can invoke it at any time to set themselves as `owner`.
- `Missing.sol:7` — Unprotected funds withdrawal: because anyone can become `owner`, they can call `withdraw()` and drain `this.balance`.

19_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. Access control (improper constructor), lines 8–10. In Solidity 0.4.24 the constructor must be named exactly `Missing`; the function named `Constructor()` stays callable by anyone, so any attacker can set themselves as `owner` and then call `withdraw()` to drain all funds.

20_access_control.sol,"1. YES  
2. Improper access control (`Wallet.sol:6-7`, `Wallet.sol:21-23`): `initWallet()` is public and can be called by anyone at any time, so any attacker can reset `creator` to themselves and then invoke `migrateTo()` to drain the entire balance to an arbitrary address.

2. - Vulnerability: Missing authorization on withdrawals  
     Lines: `EtherGet.sol:11`, `EtherGet.sol:15`  
     Reason: Both `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawEther` are `public` but never verify the caller. Any account can trigger these functions and drain all ERC‑20 tokens or Ether from the contract to the `owner`. Even though the assets end up with `owner`, this still violates the contract’s expected access control and lets an attacker empty the contract at will, disrupting any logic that requires funds to stay locked.

138_denial_of_service.sol,"YES  
- **Denial-of-Service** — `DosAuction` `bid`:7-11 — `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` lets the outgoing frontrunner block auctions by using a reverting fallback (or exhausting the 2300-gas stipend), causing the whole bid to revert and preventing new bidders.
