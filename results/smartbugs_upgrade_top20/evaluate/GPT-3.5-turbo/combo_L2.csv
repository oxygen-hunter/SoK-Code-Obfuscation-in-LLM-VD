2. Vulnerability Type: Function Name Vulnerability
   Vulnerable Line: 10
   Reason: The constructor function in Solidity should have the same name as the contract. In this case, the constructor function should be named `Missing` instead of `missing`.

2. Vulnerability Type: Missing Constructor Function
   Vulnerable Line: 9
   Reason: The constructor function is named incorrectly as `Constructor` instead of `Missing`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the constructor function should have the same name as the contract.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Lack of Access Control: The `migrateTo` function does not have proper access control. Anyone can call this function and transfer the contract's balance to any address. This can lead to unauthorized fund transfers.
     - Vulnerable line: `to.transfer(this.balance);`
     - Reason: The function should only be callable by the `creator` address to ensure proper access control.

2. Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy
   Vulnerable Lines: 20
   Reason: The `getTokens` function allows an attacker to perform a reentrancy attack by calling an external contract `addr` and then executing arbitrary code in that contract before returning to the `EtherGet` contract. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

3. The code is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the `getTokens` function allowing external contract calls without proper safeguards.",unchecked low level calls,2.0,660.0,6.0,0.8569409847259521

2. Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy
   Vulnerable Line: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`
   Reason: The `send` function is used to transfer funds to the current frontrunner. This line is vulnerable to reentrancy attack as the external call to `send` can be manipulated by the recipient contract to call back into the `DosAuction` contract before the state is updated, potentially allowing the recipient to re-enter the `bid` function and manipulate the state.

3. The code is vulnerable to reentrancy attack due to the use of the `send` function. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the `transfer` or `call.value` pattern to transfer funds and update the state variables before making any external calls.",denial of service,2.0,714.0,6.0,0.7091915607452393
