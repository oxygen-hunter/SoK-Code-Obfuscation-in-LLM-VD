2. Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy
   Vulnerable Lines: 9
   Reason: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attack as it transfers the balance to the `owner` address before updating the state. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `withdraw` function repeatedly before the state is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

3. Recommendation: To prevent reentrancy attacks, you should update the state before transferring the balance. Consider using the `transfer` function after updating the state variables.",access control,2.0,672.0,6.0,1.0208961963653564

   Reason: The `withdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attack as the `msg.sender.transfer(amount)` is called before updating the balance of the sender.

2. Vulnerability Type: Reentrancy
   Vulnerable Lines: 13
   Reason: The `getTokens` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attack as it allows an external contract to call back into the `EtherGet` contract before the completion of the function execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerabilities:
   - Reentrancy Vulnerability
     - Vulnerable lines: `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));`
     - Reason: The `send` function is used to transfer Ether to the current frontrunner. This line is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as the recipient contract can call back into the `bid` function before the state is updated, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

3. Recommended Fix:
   - Use the `transfer` function instead of `send` to transfer Ether to the current frontrunner. This will prevent reentrancy attacks as the transfer function limits the gas available to the recipient, reducing the risk of reentrancy vulnerabilities.

4. Note:
   - It's important to always consider potential reentrancy vulnerabilities when transferring Ether to external contracts.",denial of service,2.0,730.0,6.0,0.7458369731903076
