2. a) Unprotected/incorrect constructor (function missing() public { owner = msg.sender; }) — in 0.4.24 the constructor must be Missing() or constructor; this public function lets anyone set/override owner at any time, enabling unauthorized withdrawals via withdraw; b) Ownership initialization flaw (address private owner; with no proper constructor) — owner starts as 0x0 and the first/any caller of missing can seize ownership; c) Potential DoS on funds (function withdraw() public onlyowner { ... owner.transfer(...); }) — transfer reverts if owner is a contract that rejects Ether, potentially locking withdrawals.

2. Type: Unprotected ownership takeover (misnamed constructor); Vulnerable line: function Constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }; Reason: In Solidity ^0.4.24 only constructor() or a function named exactly Missing() is a constructor—""Constructor"" is just a public function, so anyone can call it anytime to set or reset owner.

2. Unprotected initialization/ownership takeover (line 5; initWallet is public and can be called/recalled by anyone to set creator, then attacker calls migrateTo at lines 15–17 to drain all ETH); Centralized drain via migrateTo (lines 15–17; creator can transfer entire balance ignoring balances mapping); Checks-Effects-Interactions violation (lines 11–13; withdraw makes external call before updating balance, risking reentrancy on refactor or gas changes); Unsafe use of assert/unchecked arithmetic (lines 7–8; assert used for validation can burn all gas and arithmetic is unchecked—prefer require and SafeMath or solidity ^0.8).

2. - Missing access control (unrestricted withdrawals): lines 9–13; anyone can call withdrawTokens/withdrawEther to move all tokens/ETH to owner (privileged action without onlyOwner).
   - Unchecked ERC20 transfer result: line 11; ignores boolean return value, potentially leaving tokens stuck if transfer returns false.
   - DoS via transfer gas stipend: line 13; using owner.transfer enforces 2300 gas and can permanently fail if owner is a contract with expensive fallback, trapping ETH.
   - Unbounded recursion/external call to untrusted address: lines 14–16; addr.call forwards (most) gas and recurses based on unvalidated num, enabling reentrancy into other public functions and gas/stack-depth DoS (even if no current state change is exploitable).

2. - SWC-113: Denial of Service via failed refund on new bids — lines 7-9 (esp. line 8: require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))); a malicious frontrunner’s fallback can revert or use >2300 gas causing send to return false, triggering require and blocking all future bids (locks the auction). 
   - SWC-102: Outdated compiler version — line 1 (pragma solidity ^0.4.15); old compiler versions have known issues; upgrade recommended. 
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions violation — lines 7-12; external call (refund) occurs before state update, amplifying DoS risk and violating the pull-payment pattern.
