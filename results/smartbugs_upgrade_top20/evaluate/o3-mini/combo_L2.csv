2. Vulnerabilities Found:
   • Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Constructor Declaration (Constructor Hijacking)
   • Vulnerable Lines: The function declaration ""function missing() public"" (lines defining the function named ""missing()"")
   • Reason: In Solidity versions 0.4.22 and later, constructors must be declared with the keyword constructor rather than a function matching the contract name. The contract is named ""Missing"" (with an uppercase “M”), but the function is named ""missing()"" (with a lowercase “m”). This mismatch means that ""missing()"" is treated as a public function, not as a constructor. Consequently, anyone can call ""missing()"" at any time to reset the owner, taking over control of the contract.

2. Vulnerability Details:
   - Vulnerability Type: Misnamed Constructor / Initialization Vulnerability
   - Vulnerable Lines: 
     • Lines defining the ""Constructor"" function (in the provided code snippet, the function named ""Constructor"" rather than a proper Solidity constructor)
   - Reason: In Solidity 0.4.24, a constructor must either use the same name as the contract (for versions before 0.4.22) or be declared with the keyword ""constructor"" (for versions 0.4.22 and later). In this code, the function is named ""Constructor"" (with an uppercase C) which does not match the contract name ""Missing"" and is not using the ""constructor"" keyword. As a result, this function is treated as a normal public function that anyone can call. This allows any user to set themselves as the owner and withdraw all the funds from the contract.

2. Vulnerabilities found:

   • Vulnerability Type: Unprotected Initialization (Missing proper constructor)
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
         • Line with ""function initWallet() public {""
     - Reason: In Solidity version 0.4.24, constructors must be declared with the same name as the contract (or using the ""constructor"" keyword in later versions). Because initWallet is a public function rather than a constructor, any user can call it after deployment and set themselves as the creator. This may allow an attacker to subsequently call the migrateTo function, transferring the balance to an address they control.

2. Vulnerabilities found:
   • Vulnerability Type: Denial-of-Service (DoS) via failed refunds.
     - Vulnerable Lines: 
         • Lines inside the bid() function, particularly the block:
           if (currentFrontrunner != 0) {
             require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
           }
     - Reason: The contract uses the send() method to refund the previous bidder. If the previous bidder is a contract with a fallback function that either requires more than 2300 gas or deliberately reverts (or otherwise fails to accept the refund), the send() will return false. This causes the require() to revert the transaction, blocking any new valid bids from being processed—effectively allowing an attacker to lock the auction by becoming the current frontrunner.
