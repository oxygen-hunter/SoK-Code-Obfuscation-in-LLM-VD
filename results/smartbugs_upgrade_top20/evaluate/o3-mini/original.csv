2. Vulnerabilities Found:

 a. Incorrect Constructor Declaration (Re-initialization Vulnerability)
  - Vulnerable Line(s): The function named ""missing()"" (line where the function is defined).
  - Reason: In Solidity versions 0.4.22 and later, including 0.4.24, constructors should be declared with the ""constructor"" keyword rather than by giving the function the same name as the contract. Since the contract is named ""Missing"" (with a capital M) and the function is named ""missing"" (with a lowercase m), the function is not recognized as the constructor. It becomes a regular public function, which means anyone can call it at any time and reset the owner to their own address. This allows an attacker to take over ownership of the contract.

2. Vulnerabilities detected:
   • Vulnerability Type: Improper Constructor Declaration (Owner Takeover)
     - Vulnerable Lines: The function declared as ""function Constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }""
     - Reason: In Solidity 0.4.24, constructors must either use the new ""constructor"" keyword or be named exactly the same as the contract (i.e. ""Missing""). Since ""Constructor"" does not match the contract name and is not defined with the ""constructor"" keyword, it is treated as a normal public function. This allows any user to call it and reset the owner to their own address, potentially enabling them to withdraw the entire contract balance via the ""withdraw"" function.

2. Vulnerabilities found:

• Missing Access Control for Withdraw Functions
  - Vulnerable lines: The entire bodies of the functions “withdrawTokens” and “withdrawEther” (roughly lines 10–14 and 15–18).
  - Reason: Neither function checks that msg.sender is the contract owner. This means any external account can call these functions, causing the contract’s tokens or Ether to be sent—even if the contract was intended",unchecked low level calls,2.0,649.0,6.0,1.5422084331512451

2. Vulnerabilities Detected:
   
   - Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service (DoS) due to the refund pattern.
   - Vulnerable Lines:  
     • The block starting at the ""if (currentFrontrunner != 0) {"" line, specifically:  
       require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));
   - Reason:  
     The contract attempts to refund the previous highest bidder using the low-level send method. Since send only forwards 2300 gas, a malicious or poorly designed contract could force the refund to fail (for example, by having a fallback function that reverts or consumes more than 2300 gas). This failure causes the require statement to revert the transaction, thereby preventing any new bids and potentially locking the auction—a classic Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.",denial of service,3.0,725.0,6.0,1.4586710929870603
